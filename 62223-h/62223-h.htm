v</span>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> author has been repeatedly
urged to print a volume of his Parochial Sermons; and perhaps he
owes some apology to those friends, whose kind advice, on this
head, has been for years neglected.&nbsp; He was apprehensive,
that the interest, excited by his discourses from the pulpit,
would not be adequately revived by their appearance in print; or
at most, that they would be impressive only upon those who had
heard them: <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>and he moreover thought, that the christian world was
already provided with more than a sufficiency of such
publications.&nbsp; However, whether these opinions be well
founded or not, he has been at length prevailed upon to defer to
the wishes and judgment of others.</p>
<p>It is almost needless to observe, that the Sermons were
written without any, the most distant, view to publication; they
pretend to nothing, but the simple and earnest inculcation of
christian principle and practice; and as this is the
author&rsquo;s sole object, so does he pour forth his humble
prayer, that what, by God&rsquo;s help, he has planted and
watered, may, by God&rsquo;s blessing, be increased to the glory
of His own great name, and the edification of His Church.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>SERMON
I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AWAKE THOU THAT SLEEPEST.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Ephesians</span> v. 14.</p>
<p><i>Wherefore</i>, <i>he saith</i>, <i>Awake</i>, <i>thou that
sleepest</i>, <i>and arise from the dead</i>, <i>and Christ shall
give thee light</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this chapter the Apostle has
been reminding his Ephesian converts of the state in which they
were, before they had received and obeyed the call of the
gospel.&nbsp; The people of Ephesus were highly endowed, in the
world&rsquo;s estimation, not only with riches, but also with
talent and learning, and refinement; with all the arts and
ornaments of civilized <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>life.&nbsp; And yet, how does St. Paul
describe them in the 8th verse?&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye were sometimes
darkness;&rdquo; how in the 12th?&nbsp; &ldquo;For it is a shame
even to speak of those things which are done of them in
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, you observe, we have a remarkable declaration from the
mouth of an Apostle, that a people, however talented and learned,
were still wrapt in the mantle of darkness, with regard to their
real good and happiness; with regard to their religious and moral
condition.&nbsp; Whatever nature had done for them, to whatever
eminence they had been raised by art or industry, they were left
far short of the object which it concerned them most to
attain&mdash;an acquaintance with God, a knowledge and practice
of His law; a peace with Him and with their own
consciences.&nbsp; So far were they from this, that their
characters were stained with the most debasing vices; their
secret sins were too abominable even to be mentioned.</p>
<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Thus we
see how little the instructions and advantages of this world have
to do with reforming the conduct, or amending the depraved heart
of man.&nbsp; And what was true in this instance, is true in all;
there is no teaching, there are no rules of prudence, no maxims
however wise, no manners however polished, that can cleanse the
heart of its natural unrighteousness, and curb its natural
propensity to evil: give what you may, educate as you may, man,
if left to his own wisdom and strength, will remain what he is by
fallen nature, a weak, a wayward, and a wicked being; an enemy to
holiness and to God.&nbsp; There may be a shew of wisdom
&ldquo;falsely so called;&rdquo; there may be a refined
conversation and a polished outside; but there will always be
uncleanness remaining within.&nbsp; The evil principles may wear
a dazzling veil, and the vices may be clothed in fashionable
garments, but they will be evil principles and vices still.</p>
<p>There is but one means by which the <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>darkness of nature can be scattered,
and that is by the light of God&rsquo;s truth; but one means by
which the evil spirit of the natural man can be cast out, and
that is by the Spirit of God.&nbsp; The blessed Jesus came into
the world to reclaim and redeem it from the grossness in which it
was sunk; to open a new scene of things; to impart a new life; to
banish the thick cloud of error and of sin, in which the world
hopelessly and irrecoverably lay; and to raise it to the
knowledge and service, the favour and blessing of an offended
God.&nbsp; This is the description of the happy effects which the
gospel is intended and fitted to produce; &ldquo;the people that
walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwell in
the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light
shined.&rdquo; <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a>&nbsp; All, without the gospel, are in
this miserable condition, whatever they may think of themselves:
all who sincerely embrace it, are enlightened and happy, however
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>poor and
humble, and of whatever else they may be ignorant.</p>
<p>Poor and humble did I say?&nbsp; It is to them, that this
light is the most easily, and frequently, and effectually
communicated.&nbsp; The prosperous and the great too often
resemble the wealthy Ephesians, &ldquo;having the understanding
darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the
ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their
heart;&rdquo; <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> revelling in the self-sufficiency of
their earthly comforts, proud of their acquirements, fond of
their own way, they disdain to be taught the humbling truths of
the gospel from a fellow-creature like themselves: and often has
the minister of the gospel to be thankful to his Lord and Master,
that, when he finds his message rejected and despised by his
wealthier hearers, it still makes its way into the hearts of some
of the poor: grieved he is indeed, that those, who ought to know
it best and love it most, should be so deluded by worldly <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>vanities and
follies, as to continue, amidst all their advantages of
education, in spiritual darkness and death; set against the
messenger, because hating the truth of his message: yet, is it a
comfort to him, sincere and unspeakable, that he meets with more
success among the ignorant, as they are called, and the children
of the poor: that there he finds wisdom, &ldquo;the wisdom which
is from above;&rdquo; and there he finds friends among the
friends of God.</p>
<p>It was so in the Apostle&rsquo;s day; and with some bright
exceptions, it has been the same in every day: &ldquo;For ye see
your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the
flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called; but God hath
chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and
God hath chosen the weak things of the world, to confound the
things that are mighty: and base things of the world, and things
which are despised hath God chosen; yea, and things which are
not, to <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>bring to nought things that are: that no flesh should
glory in his presence.&rdquo; <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p>All these observations have been made, to connect and explain
the first word of the text, <i>wherefore</i>; &ldquo;wherefore,
he saith, awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead, and
Christ shall give thee light.&rdquo;&nbsp; Inasmuch as it is
impossible for thee to know and to please God, to attain unto
holiness and happiness, to save thy soul, by the light of nature,
(for nature is in fact, of itself and for such a purpose, no
light at all,) turn to the way, which is opened to thee by the
shining of the Sun of Righteousness; to that one way, which is
opened alike for all mankind, rich and poor, learned and
unlearned; turn to thy Redeemer, in humble faith and hearty
desire, and &ldquo;He shall give thee light:&rdquo; learn of Him
and He shall teach thee all that thou needest to know: seek of
Him, and He shall guide thee into all righteousness and truth;
lean on Him, and He shall support thee, <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>through all the course of thy earthly
pilgrimage; and conduct thee in peace and safety to thy
journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore, he <i>saith</i>;&rdquo; there is no
particular passage in the Old Testament, in which these words of
the text are found; but they seem to allude to several
expressions of similar import, in the prophecy of Isaiah.&nbsp;
In the 26th chapter, there is a passage which describes the
deliverance of God&rsquo;s people from a state of degradation,
both political and spiritual, under the figure of a resurrection
from the dead: &ldquo;Thy dead men shall live, together with my
dead body shall they arise.&nbsp; Awake and sing, ye that dwell
in dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall
cast out the dead.&rdquo; <a name="citation8"></a><a
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a>&nbsp; And again, in
the 52nd chapter: &ldquo;Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O
Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the Holy city;
for henceforth there shall no more come in to thee the
uncircumcised and the unclean; shake thyself from the dust; <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>arise and sit
down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O
captive daughter of Zion: for thus saith the Lord, ye have sold
yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without
money:&rdquo; <a name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a> a powerful call upon the Jewish people
to cast away their transgressions, through which they had been
brought into a state of grievous captivity, and to throw
themselves on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, and return to the
Lord&rsquo;s service, that He might break their bonds asunder,
and visit them with His salvation.&nbsp; One more passage there
is, to which the Apostle clearly alludes, in the opening of the
60th chapter: &ldquo;Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the
glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.&nbsp; For behold, the
darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people:
but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen
upon thee.&rdquo; <a name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a>&nbsp; Here the prophet foretels the
glorious dawn of gospel light, and calls upon the Church to arise
and behold it, <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>shining from afar; to behold it with the eye of faith;
to look forward to that Saviour, that great &ldquo;fountain for
sin and uncleanness,&rdquo; which the law and the prophets did
all with one voice proclaim.&nbsp; The prophet adds, &ldquo;And
the gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness
of thy rising.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first coming of the gentile world
was visible in the footsteps of the wise men, who came
&ldquo;from the east to Jerusalem,&rdquo; <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a> to worship the infant Jesus: and ever
since our Lord&rsquo;s return to the heavens, the gospel has been
preached to all nations; and accepted, more or less, by the kings
and potentates of the earth.</p>
<p>And, as the prophet called on the people of old, to awake and
arise and turn to the coming light, so St. Paul invited and
animated his converts and their brethren, to awake and behold the
glory of the Lord, after it had been fully revealed to the dark
and sinful world; and so do the ministers of Christ, in every
age, call upon <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>their hearers to arouse from their benighted and lost
condition, and let this light shine upon their understandings and
hearts, and direct them in the way of life and salvation.&nbsp;
For grieved are we to say, that notwithstanding these bright
beams of grace and truth have been so long pouring forth their
splendour upon the earth, yet are there many dark corners; and
many eyes awfully closed against the light: and still more
grieved are we to say, that even in the land where these beams
have shone brightest, even in this land, vast numbers yet remain
total strangers to their enlightening influence and converting
power: numbers who have had the benefit of being educated under
the gospel, who have witnessed its happy effects; who have seen
what it has done for their relations, or friends, or neighbours,
have yet ungratefully and disdainfully turned away from the
heavenly light, and &ldquo;walked on still in darkness;&rdquo;
have sided with the world and Satan and sin, and resisted the
salvation of their souls.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>O, that
they could be brought, O for the grace of God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit
to bring them, to listen to the warning words of that merciful
Saviour, to whom, if they now continue to despise Him, they will
one day lift up their hands in vain: these are His words,
&ldquo;if the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is
that darkness.&rdquo; <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; If, after all
the gracious offers of pardon and life, which thy Redeemer has
made thee, by His own mouth, and the mouth of His messengers,
thou still choosest unforgiveness and death, going on in the
heedlessness of thy impenitent heart, and wantoning in sin, how
dreadful is thy condition! how infinitely more dreadful, than if
the voice of mercy had never sounded in thine ears.&nbsp; Be
convinced: let the love of thy Saviour work upon thee; let the
love of thine own immortal soul move thee to fly unto Him, the
great, the only, the everlasting Redeemer.&nbsp; Leave thy way of
misery and ruin, and turn to Him for comfort and
deliverance.&nbsp; <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Turn, while thou hast the power; the night is fast
coming.&nbsp; Thou knowest not how many more sabbaths, how many
more invitations and warnings, will be vouchsafed: many thou hast
had already; enough of them thou hast already slighted.&nbsp;
Come, ye that are strong, for the strong are often laid low;
come, ye that are young, for the young are not always spared;
come, ye aged, for your hour of trial <i>must</i> be nearly run
out.&nbsp; Come all, while ye may, to the Lamb of God, for
acceptance and for blessing: there is no safety, and no hope in
any other: and no hope in Him, when the door is once shut;
&ldquo;we pray you, in Christ&rsquo;s stead, be ye reconciled to
God.&rdquo; <a name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a></p>
<p>The text says, &ldquo;Awake thou that sleepest;&rdquo; it
means, awake from the sleep of sin; and very fitly is the state
of the sinner compared to a state of sleep: he is quite
insensible of his true, his awful condition; he fears not,
perceives not, the doom that is awaiting him.&nbsp; Satan has <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>bound up his
senses; the eyes of his understanding are closed, and his
knowledge of good and evil is utterly prevented.&nbsp; He is to
the spiritual world, what the sleeping man is to the natural,
unconscious of what is going forward to his advantage or his
injury.&nbsp; Speak to him of mercy, he hears not: &ldquo;sing
him one of the songs of Sion,&rdquo; it is all in vain: speak to
him of divine wrath, of eternal punishment; to what purpose,
while his ear is closed?&nbsp; The whispers of conscience, the
counsel of friends, &ldquo;the tongues of men or of
angels,&rdquo; are alike unprofitable, while a deep sleep is cast
upon the soul.</p>
<p>And there is a further resemblance: the sinner dreams, of
happiness arising from worldly prosperity, from plenty and
pleasure: and as the brain of a poor or disconsolate man, in a
state of sleep, is often filled with ideas of such things, and he
awakes and finds them sadly untrue; awakes from his pleasant
dreaming to his state of drudgery and discomfort; so is the
sinner often constrained to feel and confess, <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>that his
notions of happiness were no better than a dream; that they were
unsubstantial and unreal, promising much and bringing little:
still he is unconvinced; pursues his course of trifling, his
disappointed dreamings, till at length he awakes in another
world, and thoroughly perceives the wretchedness of his
condition, which it is then too late, impossible to change.&nbsp;
From this dreadful, fatal sleep of sin, the gospel is designed to
rouse us: and I pray God, that our conscience may be effectually
alarmed and awakened; that we may be alive and active in
perceiving and following &ldquo;the things that belong unto our
peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The text says further, &ldquo;Arise from the dead;&rdquo; from
the death of sin; from the state of misery and ruin, in which ye
insensibly lie.&nbsp; Here is another significant figure: the
impenitent sinner is not only plunged into a condition of
helpless wretchedness, but he has no energy to recover from it,
no quickening or effectual desire of better things; no more
perception <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>of spiritual interests, of heavenly objects, than a
corpse has of the natural world.&nbsp; When once the breath has
left the body, the busiest scenes of earth can affect it no
longer; nothing can &ldquo;charm the dull cold ear of
death:&rdquo; when the breath of a divine life is not in the
soul, when the new-creating spirit of God is not received and
cherished, the beauty of holiness and the all-important interests
of a spiritual and eternal world produce no effect upon the
forlorn understanding and the deserted heart: no representations
of spiritual truth can move the heavy ear of a besotted and
determined sinner; none, while he is resolved, so to remain: not
even the voice of the Son of God, &ldquo;charm He never so
wisely.&rdquo;&nbsp; Till the heart be moved to repentance, till,
the faculties of the soul are recovered from the fascination of
stupor and sin, no living impression can be made, even with all
the force that truth can carry.&nbsp; How often do we find this
to be the case! how often does the sinner acknowledge the
justice, <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>the certainty, the necessity of what is urged upon him,
but without any alteration in his character; without any
effectual or lasting alteration.&nbsp; His heart is unchanged:
the slave of sin; dead in sin; not alive or open to the force of
truth, to the doctrines of righteousness or salvation.</p>
<p>Infatuated sinner! thine own conscience accuses thee; thou
believest that there will be a world to come, a world of
recompence, and yet thou turnest not to prepare for it; pray,
when thou fearest; pray, when thou thinkest of these things; cry
earnestly to thy Saviour, that he may deliver thee from this
&ldquo;gall of bitterness and this bond of iniquity;&rdquo; pray
for the convincing, converting, life-giving Spirit, that He may
&ldquo;set thine heart at liberty&rdquo; from the thraldom of
sin; and thus enable thee to listen to the call of the gospel,
and turn thy feet in earnest to the Redeemer of thy soul.&nbsp;
For if thou listenest and turnest not, &ldquo;dead thou art while
thou livest;&rdquo; and when thou diest, eternally <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>dead; dead to
all comfort and happiness for ever; dead in a world of woe.</p>
<p>But if we will (and God grant that we all may) awake and
arise, &ldquo;Christ will assuredly give us light:&rdquo;
&ldquo;He is the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh
into the world;&rdquo; <a name="citation18"></a><a
href="#footnote18" class="citation">[18]</a> ready to shine upon
every soul, to lighten it in darkness and quicken it in
death.&nbsp; Believe in Him, and live in Him, and the clouds of
ignorance shall be scattered away; and the drowsiness of the soul
shall be cast off; and the cold heart of the natural man shall be
warm with life again.&nbsp; In the midst of this world&rsquo;s
temptations and trials, troubles and perplexities, we shall see
our way clear, our way to the heavenly Jerusalem; a brightness,
the brightness of God&rsquo;s presence, will be resting upon our
souls; the world sees it not, but we shall see and enjoy it every
hour: dark things will be made light, and &ldquo;crooked things
will be made straight, and the rough places plain:&rdquo; we
shall be living above <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>the world, for &ldquo;our life will
be hid with Christ in God:&rdquo; <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a> cheerful we shall be
when nature is sad: inspirited when nature is languishing; full
of praises and thanksgivings when nature is mourning.</p>
<p>Say, Christian people, have ye never seen the triumph of faith
over nature&rsquo;s weakness and Satan&rsquo;s power? have ye
never, in the hour of trial, witnessed that the Saviour was near?
never observed the fainting spirit animated and sustained? never
beheld the closing eye, of the dying saint, beaming with heavenly
fire; and the pale features lighted up with the smile of
satisfaction and composure and peace?&nbsp; If ye have not, the
dying Christian will shew you these things&mdash;go to his bed,
and learn the lesson; go, and catch the hope, that &ldquo;Christ
will give you light.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>SERMON

<span class="GutSmall">THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF
CHRIST.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Eph</span>. iii 8.<br />
<i>The unsearchable riches of Christ</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no passage, in the whole
range of Scripture, in which the benefits and blessings of the
gospel are more strikingly and fully represented, than by these
few words: it is elsewhere described as the &ldquo;pearl of great
price,&rdquo; as &ldquo;the treasure that fadeth not away,&rdquo;
as &ldquo;the true riches;&rdquo; but here, as if in addition to
the former descriptions, it is called, under the direction of the
Holy Spirit, &ldquo;the unsearchable riches of Christ:&rdquo;
impossible for men, impossible for angels to search out and
discover its full excellency and value.&nbsp; The more it is
examined, <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>and the more it is experimentally known, the more is the
believer convinced of the propriety and truth of this
description; without a deep enquiry indeed, without a vital
experience of its blessedness, it is not for any one to
understand even the nature of its transcendent riches; to the
world at large they are known only by name: but the sincere
Christian, who makes them his own, is brought to admire their
inexhaustible fulness; and to perceive, how utterly they extend
beyond his comprehension, how highly they are removed above his
loftiest thoughts and his most ardent imagination: &ldquo;eye
hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart
of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love
him.&rdquo; <a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a>&nbsp; They lie entirely out of the
reach of the natural man; and even the spiritual man does but
imperfectly understand them.</p>
<p>These unsearchable riches it was the province of St. Paul
especially to declare <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>unto the gentile world, that is, unto
the world at large, when the offer of them had been rejected by
the Jewish nation: in consequence of which blessed communication
to the gentiles, the knowledge of them was conveyed, in process
of time, to our favoured land.</p>
<p>Many learned persons have believed, that St. Paul himself
preached in this island; of this, however, there is no certain
evidence; it is enough for us to know, that we are partakers of
the benefit of his preaching, that the sound of the gospel, which
he sent &ldquo;forth into all lands,&rdquo; has long ago reached
us; and that we are now in the full enjoyment of this inestimable
privilege.&nbsp; He declares, in the chapter, before us, that
Jesus Christ, by express revelation, made known to him the great
mystery, the unfathomable purpose of His mercy; &ldquo;which in
other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now
revealed unto the holy Apostles and Prophets by the Spirit: that
the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>same body,
and partakers of His promise in Christ by the
gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unto me, he says, &ldquo;who am less than
the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should
preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of
Christ.&nbsp; And to make all men see what is the fellowship of
the mystery, which, from the beginning of the world, hath been
hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ.&rdquo; <a
name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a></p>
<p>You perceive here the object of the Apostle&rsquo;s preaching;
it was, that all mankind, we among the number, might be brought
acquainted with the glorious scheme of eternal redemption, and be
made partakers of its unspeakable blessings.&nbsp; And is there a
heart so cold, as not to beat with gratitude, in the remembrance
of such mercy; as not to take an interest in such a testimony of
divine love?&nbsp; If we knew no particulars respecting it, the
very announcement and promise of an infinite treasure, of a
treasure in the mansions of eternity, were sufficient to awaken
our <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>most
profound attention: it often does so, when carried by the
missionary to the heathen and the stranger; they, who never heard
before the good tidings of salvation, are arrested by the voice
of the messenger, and hang upon his lips with a longing anxiety,
and receive his message to the comfort of their souls: and can we
remain unmoved by such considerations; we, who know the purport
of the heavenly message; we, who profess to believe that it is
sent for our everlasting salvation from sin and death; to
reconcile us to an offended God, to deliver us from the
intolerable bondage of Satan, to make us happy while we live,
happy when we die, happy for ever in another world, in the
kingdom of heaven?&nbsp; Though the mercy is too great to be
adequately understood, though &ldquo;the love of Christ passeth
knowledge,&rdquo; shall this prevent us from contemplation and
enquiry? shall we not rather, on this very account, entertain a
more fervent desire to understand and know, of this mystery of
goodness, all <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>that is possible to be known?&nbsp; Whoever, indeed, has
not this desire, cannot take any lively interest in the
revelation which he professes to believe, cannot have sincerely
embraced it; knowing, as he does, the subject and purpose of the
gospel, he is in a worse situation than many an ignorant heathen;
his heart more hard and unimpressible; his eyes more closed
against the light; his affections more difficult to be roused and
engaged.&nbsp; May the Lord touch the heart of all such heedless
professors; or the very publicans and sinners, the darkest and
most despised of the earth, will &ldquo;enter into the kingdom of
heaven before them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hoping that we all are deeply concerned in this important
matter, that we do place a most exalted value on the riches of
Christ, and earnestly desire to partake of them, I beg that we
may enter together, with humble minds and spiritual desires, into
some examination of their nature and excellency; and enquire in
<a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>what
respects, and for what reasons, they are unsearchable.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In the first place, what is the foundation of all our
blessedness and all our hope, as the redeemed and adopted
children of God; as brought from a state of enmity and rebellion,
into favour with Him; as having any claim upon His mercy; any
prospect of recovering our lost happiness, of saving our souls
alive?&nbsp; What, I say, is the foundation on which we expect
these marvellous acts of grace?&nbsp; It is, that the everlasting
Son of God left &ldquo;the glory which he had with the Father
before the world was,&rdquo; <a name="citation26a"></a><a
href="#footnote26a" class="citation">[26a]</a> and &ldquo;took
upon Him the form of a servant,&rdquo; <a
name="citation26b"></a><a href="#footnote26b"
class="citation">[26b]</a> the nature of man: it is, that the
&ldquo;Word, who in the beginning was with God and was
God,&rdquo; &ldquo;was made flesh&rdquo; and came and
&ldquo;dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation26c"></a><a href="#footnote26c"
class="citation">[26c]</a>&nbsp; Here then, in the very outset,
is unsearchable mercy; the immensity of the divine
Redeemer&rsquo;s condescension and love!&nbsp; Who can search,
who can understand it?&nbsp; <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>&ldquo;It is higher than heaven, what
canst thou know&rdquo; of it?&nbsp; Admire thou mayest, and adore
and love; but it is beyond the stretch of thy created powers to
conceive, beyond the capacity of any creature.&nbsp; The great
truth is revealed and the work is accomplished; and here thou
must leave it, in humble faith and overwhelming emotion.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; We may consider, in the next place, the preciousness,
the value, the efficacy of the incarnation and sufferings of our
Redeemer.&nbsp; All the attributes of the Godhead are perfect and
infinite; His holiness and justice, as well as His mercy.&nbsp;
Man, by transgression, fell into a state of unholiness; his
nature became corrupt; his understanding debased, his affections
and passions and desires all sinful; as such he could not
possibly be accepted or blest by the infinitely holy God, by Him
&ldquo;who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity:&rdquo; he
became, to borrow the language of men, vile and hateful in
God&rsquo;s sight; he resembled Satan and the wicked spirits, <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>who fell, for
their transgression, from the heavens.&nbsp; And so, with regard
to justice; the infinitely just God could not, without some means
of atonement or satisfaction, shew favour to a disobedient,
offending, rebellious creature; it was contrary to His essential
character and nature so to do: nor can we form any true idea of
the value of that sacrifice, on the part of another, which could
be held sufficient to reconcile the great Jehovah to a creature
&ldquo;laden with iniquity:&rdquo; the displeasure being
infinite, the distance and separation between God and His
creatures infinite, the sacrifice must be infinite also, and
exceeding the bounds of our comprehension.&nbsp; And yet, strange
to say, though the means of the sinner&rsquo;s re-admission, to
the favour and blessing of a holy and just God, must of necessity
be beyond our powers of conception, there are persons, who object
to the Christian doctrine of the atonement, solely on the ground
of its being incomprehensible.&nbsp; But we, my brethren,
&ldquo;have not so learned Christ;&rdquo; we are ready <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>to bow with
thankfulness to the revelation of the great Jehovah, by whose
unsearchable wisdom and mercy the plan of our redemption was
formed: we are ready to acknowledge with reverence, that
&ldquo;great is the mystery of godliness; God was manifest in the
flesh.&rdquo; <a name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a"
class="citation">[29a]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Intimately connected with this consideration is the
recollection of God&rsquo;s exceeding love towards us, in that
&ldquo;while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.&rdquo; <a
name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b"
class="citation">[29b]</a>&nbsp; In our very state of guilt and
rebellion it was, that He came into the world; that He did and
suffered so much, &ldquo;to seek and to save that which was
lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Suppose that man had never transgressed; and
that God had sent an angel, to shew him the way to a happier and
higher condition, than that in which he was created: this would
have been an act of free and undeserved mercy; but that He should
have sent His beloved Son, to &ldquo;suffer for sins, the just
for the unjust,&rdquo; <a name="citation29c"></a><a
href="#footnote29c" class="citation">[29c]</a> to be born and to
tabernacle in a world of guilt and <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>sorrow; to be exposed to rejection
and scorn, to indignity and cruelty; to endure the conflicts of
Satan and the bitterest agonies of death; this was indeed an act
of love, surpassing the bounds of thought; a mystery of goodness
&ldquo;into which angels desire to look,&rdquo; but cannot
penetrate.&nbsp; Every believing soul must be overpowered by such
a contemplation; must be lost in wonder, love, and praise.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Nor can we learn the manner or degree, in which our
merciful Lord is at this moment bestowing blessings upon His
Church, and upon every individual believer.&nbsp; When He
ascended up to heaven, His work of mediation was not finished; He
then took upon Him the office of interceding for His people in
all ages: presenting their prayers, and desires, and all their
services, for acceptance at the throne of grace; pleading His
merits for them; observing all their necessities and wants; and
sending His holy spirit and His holy angels, to minister to their
infirmities: not a wounded spirit, but He is still ready to <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>bind up and
heal; not a sigh from a contrite heart, but He knows and answers;
not a child of ignorance, but He is willing to instruct; not a
returning prodigal, but He meets; not a prayer or thanksgiving,
not a godly thought or wish, of a sincere worshipper and pious
servant, but He accepts and blesses: He is ever with us, though
unseen; with us by His providence and grace; &ldquo;about our bed
and about our path;&rdquo; pouring his benefits upon us,
temporal, and spiritual: yea upon all His people, at every moment
of time, throughout the whole world.&nbsp; We are lost in this
mystery of mercy&mdash;we can but believe, and gratefully apply
the benefit to our souls.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; And what are the privileges of Christ&rsquo;s
redeemed people?&nbsp; What their present state, what their
glorious inheritance?&nbsp; How unsearchable both the one and the
other!&nbsp; The humble believer, the repenting sinner, the
sincere and faithful servant derives, from the fountain of mercy
which is opened unto him, a perpetual stream of <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>increasing
satisfaction and delight; he finds, that &ldquo;there is no end
thereof;&rdquo; that it is a fountain, which he never can
fathom.&nbsp; The sense of pardon and reconciliation with God
affords a comfort to his soul, which flows the more abundantly,
the longer he dwells upon it; as he journies onward in the way of
salvation, his hopes are more enlivened, and his fears more
calmed; even when he began to walk with his God, he felt that all
around him was joy, and deemed his recompence in this life amply
sufficient; but, at every step he advances in communion with his
God and Saviour, he perceives more and more that &ldquo;His ways
are ways of pleasantness and all His paths are peace;&rdquo; <a
name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a> and this experience will be enlarged
the longer he lives, even beyond his present anticipation.&nbsp;
The word of God has fresh stores for him every day; of knowledge,
of comfort, and of grace: the Spirit of God has fresh supplies;
to succour his infirmities, to elevate him in <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>prayer and
meditation, to guide him in perplexity, to strengthen him in
trial, to console him in trouble and affliction, to raise him
above the world, and place his affections in heaven.&nbsp; Thus
will his joy in the Lord increase, till he comes to the end of
his pilgrimage: and, in the end, the riches of redeeming love
will be infinitely enhanced: who shall number or declare
them?&nbsp; Which of us can now understand the preciousness of a
Christian&rsquo;s hope, the comfort of a Christian&rsquo;s peace,
at that hour, when his soul is struggling for departure?&nbsp;
Who can now enter, as the dying man does, into the vast
difference between the bright hope of being saved, and the gloomy
fear of being lost; between the prospect of being for ever with
the Lord, and the dismal foreboding of the terrors of the evil
one?&nbsp; We have now but a slight conception of the feelings
and views, in that momentous hour; but we shall one day know: God
grant that the knowledge may be peace!</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>And if
we die in peace, then shall we be more than ever convinced of the
truth of the text; we shall then perceive, how little we
comprehended, in our mortal state, of the blessedness of the
saints at rest, of &ldquo;the rest that remaineth for the people
of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, at the resurrection, other scenes will
follow, with more abundant tokens of confirmation: who can
conceive the happiness of rising with the just; of hearing with
joy the trumpet of the archangel; of beholding, with an eye of
rapture, the beaming of that glorious morn; of meeting the smile
of a compassionate Judge and Saviour; of being called to His
right hand, &ldquo;come, ye blessed of my father, inherit the
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:&rdquo;
<a name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a"
class="citation">[34a]</a> what mind on earth is equal to these
things?</p>
<p>And then will succeed the consummation of our felicity,
&ldquo;the new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth
righteousness;&rdquo; <a name="citation34b"></a><a
href="#footnote34b" class="citation">[34b]</a> the enjoyment of
the <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>presence of God and the Lamb; the personal sharing of
the service, the honour, and the delight of angels and
archangels, through all eternity.&nbsp; Of this we cannot pretend
to form an estimate in our mortal condition; while the veil is
hanging before our eyes; the holy Spirit, by many a sublime
image, lifts our imagination as high as it can be carried; but
still, the representation must be feeble, when compared with the
glorious reality; after all that has been said, if we arrive at
the heavenly city, the appearance will be new, the happiness new
to us all.&nbsp; Unsearchable it is now, unsearchable it will be
then; a wonder of love that will never be satisfied, a mansion of
glory that will never be completely surveyed.</p>
<p>But we shall doubtless behold, on seeing &ldquo;face to
face,&rdquo; more of the fulness of the riches of Christ; shall
penetrate further into that mystery of divine love, which planned
the merciful work of our redemption before the foundation of the
world; shall see more <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>of the meetness of the
Saviour&rsquo;s sufferings; of His mighty conquest over sin and
death; of the greatness of His kingdom and the &ldquo;majesty of
His glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; We shall then see and admire that now
invisible bond, by which the whole company of the Lord&rsquo;s
servants and people, heavenly and earthly, have been sustained
and kept together: how men below, and saints at rest, and angels
in heaven, have been bound in spiritual union, through all the
ages of time; how the vast multitude of holy creatures in the
universe have felt a common interest and benefit in their blessed
Lord. <a name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a>&nbsp; When they are all assembled
together in adoration round His throne, we shall know more of
this endearing bond; it will then be manifest, and be perfected
for ever.</p>
<p>I need not attempt to go further; certainly none of us will
deny the unsearchableness of the riches of Christ.&nbsp;
Certainly every one of us is ready to exclaim, O that I may be
partaker of them; all this <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>world, nay, a thousand worlds are
nothing in comparison.&nbsp; These riches are now offered to you:
they are waiting your acceptance; receive them with all your
heart, and they are yours; you do not expect them to be forced
upon you; you do not expect this happy portion without choosing
it, without prayer and without striving for it; ask earnestly,
seek diligently, and it shall be yours; your inexhaustible
treasure, in time and to eternity.</p>
<h2><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>SERMON
III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FLOOD.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Genesis</span> vi. 6. 7.</p>
<p><i>It repented the Lord</i>, <i>that He had made man upon the
earth and it grieved Him at His heart</i>; <i>and the Lord
said</i>, <i>I will destroy man</i>, <i>whom I have created</i>,
<i>from the face of the earth</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> expression in the former clause
of the text has, to some persons, afforded matter of surprise;
and certainly the language is remarkable; representing the
Almighty as repenting of the work of creation, and grieved at the
heart, not merely on account of the wickedness of man, but that
he was ever made.&nbsp; Yet the language, when properly
considered, is no more remarkable, than that of numberless <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>other
passages in Holy Writ; it is stronger perhaps; it may carry the
customary mode of speech somewhat further; but that is all.&nbsp;
We are perfectly aware, that the Godhead is incapable of being
affected and changed by contrary passions, as we are; the purpose
of Jehovah is fixed, upon the basis of infinite wisdom, from
everlasting to everlasting; nothing can occur, of which He was
previously ignorant; nothing to afford any grief or uneasiness;
&ldquo;known unto God are all His works from the beginning of the
world;&rdquo; <a name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39"
class="citation">[39]</a> and it is impossible for us to
interpret the text, or any similar phrase, according to the sense
in which we understated such words, when applied to creatures
like ourselves.</p>
<p>It was absolutely necessary for the inspired writers, in
describing the nature and dealings and dispensations of God, to
have recourse to such terms, as we are in the habit of using
towards one another.&nbsp; His constant observance of us is
represented <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>by saying, that the <i>eye</i> of God is upon all our
ways; His gracious readiness to answer our prayers, is
represented by saying, that His <i>ear</i> is ever open: but who
ever supposes that eye or ear, or any bodily parts, are possessed
by the Godhead?&nbsp; So neither are we to impute to God, who is
a pure spirit, any bodily passions; though He is said to love and
to hate, to be angry and to be pleased.&nbsp; Of course it only
means, that the effect of any particular conduct or transaction
of His creatures upon Him, is similar to what it would be upon
us, when under the influence of our natural passions; that He
rewardeth good, as we do, when we love or are pleased; and
punisheth evil, as we do, when we hate or are angry.&nbsp; The
text merely intimates the measure, which the Almighty was
determined to adopt, in consequence of the great and universal
wickedness of mankind; of their having so far fallen from the
noble end of their creation.</p>
<p>Having tried many gracious methods of <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>indulgence
with them, and sought to reclaim them by every probable and
possible means, and having found that His goodness and
forbearance, instead of &ldquo;leading them to repentance,&rdquo;
only hardened them in guilt, He now saw fit to change His
overtures of mercy into the sentence of condemnation; and to send
a deluge for the destruction of that people, who would not
&ldquo;turn and live:&rdquo; and this is all that can be intended
by God&rsquo;s repentance and grief.</p>
<p>But it happened in those days, as it has too frequently
happened with the sinful and rebellious ever since, that the
people believed not the threatenings denounced against them;
whether they doubted the power of God to inflict so extraordinary
a punishment; or whether they built their hopes upon the vain
expectation of His mercy; or whether the wickedness of their
hearts and lives led them entirely to cast off the belief of God
and His word, and to plunge unheeding into the gratifications and
pollutions of vice; whatever were the operating motive,
&ldquo;they would <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>not turn and seek after God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet these
infatuated people were not lost for want of further instruction
and admonition.&nbsp; God mercifully thinks of His creatures,
though they are forgetful of Him.&nbsp; He had raised unto them
preachers of righteousness; and sent His Holy Spirit to work upon
their consciences, to convert them from the delusions of evil, to
teach them the knowledge of His ways, and persuade them to desist
from their work of self-destruction.&nbsp; But there is a day, to
nations as well as to individuals, beyond which the goodness and
patience of God will no longer forbear: &ldquo;My spirit,&rdquo;
says He, in the chapter before us, &ldquo;shall not always strive
with man.&rdquo;&nbsp; It had been working in the human heart,
ever since the fall; inspiring His servants to point out the way
of salvation; and struggling with the wayward inclinations, the
perverse opposition of His creatures; to mortify the power of
sin, and lead them to recover the favour and happiness, which
their first parents by transgression had lost.&nbsp; But <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>it shall not
<i>always</i> strive; and the approaching termination of their
trial was thus graciously declared to this &ldquo;disobedient and
gainsaying people.&rdquo;&nbsp; God spake thus by the mouth of
Noah: &ldquo;The days of man (the time which I will allow, to see
if &lsquo;haply he will repent and seek after Me,&rsquo;) shall
be a hundred and twenty years.&rdquo; <a
name="citation43a"></a><a href="#footnote43a"
class="citation">[43a]</a>&nbsp; All this period was to elapse
between the denunciation of the divine vengeance and its
execution; and to this St. Peter alludes, when speaking of
&ldquo;the long-suffering of God, that waited in the days of
Noah, while the ark was preparing;&rdquo; <a
name="citation43b"></a><a href="#footnote43b"
class="citation">[43b]</a> while Noah himself, the great
&ldquo;preacher of righteousness,&rdquo; warned all around him of
the certainty and the terror of this impending calamity.&nbsp;
All entreaties, however, and warnings, and threatenings; all
present mercies and past experiences, were vain.&nbsp; They
despised the faith and rejected the preaching of the patriarch,
and ridiculed his preparation of the ark; but they could not <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>&ldquo;make
the word of God of none effect;&rdquo; His judgment overtook them
in the midst of their rebellious career; the flood came at the
appointed time; desolation was spread over the face of the earth;
and all its inhabitants, with the exception of one family, were
indiscriminately involved in the wide-wasting ruin.</p>
<p>Let us pause for a moment, to apply the consideration of this
part of the history to ourselves.&nbsp; To all who are wilfully
walking in the ways of sin, the good and gracious God is
continually addressing His warning and expostulating voice; by
His holy word, abounding with the most awakening admonitions and
awful examples; by His appointed ministers, superadding their
feeble endeavours to inculcate the doctrines and set forth the
terrors of that word &ldquo;by line upon line and precept upon
precept;&rdquo; by various occurrences in life, by reverses and
privations and afflictions and sickness and death; by the
strivings of the Holy Spirit, and the alarms of conscience; by
flashing <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>at intervals, in vivid colours, the conviction of an
hereafter upon the mind and heart; and compelling the sinner to
see, whether he will heed it or not, the peril and the
dreadfulness of his situation.&nbsp; Of all who hear me there
cannot be one, but has experienced, more or less, these
manifestations of mercy and of terror: Are there not some by whom
they have been disregarded?&nbsp; We have all of us been
instructed and reminded and admonished, in a great variety of
ways; have we &ldquo;profited withal?&rdquo;&nbsp; Have we been
awakened from the dreams of sensual pleasures, from the stupor
and infatuation of sin?&nbsp; Can we now lift up our hearts in
sincerity to God, and thank Him that we have been brought, by
this or that warning, into nearer and holier communion with Him;
to serve Him in righteousness and truth, and to seek, in right
earnest, the salvation of our souls?&nbsp; If it be otherwise
with us, if we have neglected the seasons of grace, or if we have
returned, after a temporary humiliation and conviction to <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>the vanity of
our former habits and pursuits, let us, if we believe the word of
God, lay seriously to heart the solemn declarations on this head,
with which that word abounds&mdash;that there is a limit
prescribed even for the divine compassion and forbearance; a
period marked out, beyond which God will not manifest His favour,
&ldquo;though it be sought with tears;&rdquo; beyond which,
&ldquo;His spirit will not strive with man;&rdquo; and whenever
that spirit shall be withdrawn, the conscience will become
hardened, the understanding benighted, and the sinner
&ldquo;given over to a reprobate mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; God allows,
indeed He has already allowed, to every one of us, abundant space
and opportunity for repentance, as He did of old to the
ante-diluvian race; and if we, like them, are negligent of His
merciful admonitions, we must expect, like them, to go on from
one degree of wickedness to another, till the &ldquo;measure of
our iniquity be filled;&rdquo; till we are hurried into
everlasting perdition.</p>
<p>No doubt, when the threatenings of the <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Almighty
began to be executed; when the mighty waters were descending from
above, and rising in billows from the deep below; when these
people saw the ark, whose building and preparation they had
despised, floating in security upon the surface of the waters,
gladly would they have been admitted: no longer did they question
the power of God, or the truth of His word; or hold in contempt
the preaching of His prophets; earnest then, no doubt, was their
supplication for mercy; and they must have wished, in the
bitterness of their hearts, that they had listened to the
declarations and instructions of that holy minister of God, who
was provided with a refuge; who was escaping unhurt amidst the
rolling of the waves, which threatened <i>them</i> with immediate
and inevitable destruction.&nbsp; But their conviction came too
late; the days of reconciliation were ended; the door of the ark
was shut; never to be opened again, till the flood had wrought
its vengeance, and exterminated the sinners from the earth.</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>Has not
the like, the parallel of this dreadful case, been frequently
discovered by ourselves?&nbsp; Have we not seen, or at least
heard of persons, who have held out impenitently all their lives
long against every means of grace and reclaim, by which they have
been visited, and then at last, when suddenly overtaken by a
sickness unto death, have distressfully desired that comfort and
refuge, which they have never appeared to find?&nbsp; Their
attention has been called, their eye directed to the ark of
salvation, the gospel of the blessed Jesus; but having taken no
interest in it before, having discarded and rejected it, they
have seemed to behold it only in dismay and despair.&nbsp; Man,
it is true, is not an adequate judge in such a case; he could not
possibly decide, whether they were saved or not; but there was
fear all around; their friends were denied the consolation of
persuading themselves, that the door of mercy was opened; the
sinner cried in agony, but there was no visible sign, that the
cry <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>was
heard; no respite to the afflicted conscience; and no repose upon
the countenance, that betokened the blessedness of peace.</p>
<p>Suppose not, that this is a scene pourtrayed for the mere
purpose of a momentary excitement or present effect; it is a true
description of what has too frequently occurred; and it falls
indeed, as every representation must fall, infinitely short of
the terrible reality.&nbsp; Readily can we imagine the sufferings
and sorrow and distress of the people, who were drowning, with
the ark before their eyes; and must we not conclude, that the
impenitent sinner under the gospel, when he comes to die, will
behold, with even deeper feelings of anguish, the ark of
righteousness into which he has never sought to enter; when he
finds or fears, that the overflowings of ungodliness are sinking
his soul to ruin, can any description exaggerate, can any
description equal, the wretchedness of his condition?</p>
<p>The very idea and contemplation of these <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>things may
well lead us, with all sincerity and fervour, to implore the
grace of God, while it is so freely offered, and to &ldquo;seek
Him while He may be found;&rdquo; and O that it may lead us
gladly and unfeignedly to embrace the covenant of safety, which
is graciously propounded to us in the gospel; and to &ldquo;give
all diligence&rdquo; to fulfil every condition which that
covenant contains.&nbsp; We shall not, if we value our eternal
welfare, think it sufficient not to &ldquo;deny the Lord that
bought us,&rdquo; not to despise the means which He has provided
for our preservation and deliverance; we shall turn to Him with
all our heart, grateful for the means of salvation, and anxious
to employ them all.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord what wilt Thou have me to
do?&rdquo; <a name="citation50a"></a><a href="#footnote50a"
class="citation">[50a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak, Lord, for thy
servant heareth;&rdquo; <a name="citation50b"></a><a
href="#footnote50b" class="citation">[50b]</a> this is the
language that befits a sinner, who has no hope but in God&rsquo;s
covenanted mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our time is in the Lord&rsquo;s hands;&rdquo; we know
not, if little or much remain: <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Arise, defer not a day.&nbsp; His
spirit is now striving within us; to purify our affections, to
change our corrupt nature, to form the christian principle and
temper in our souls; let us then, without doubt or delay, humbly
and thankfully concur with His holy operations, and strive with
Him, while we may: not lingering and loitering about the ark with
thoughtless indifference, as if our minds were not made up,
whether it be worth while to enter; but, in the full and perfect
and abiding persuasion, that it is the only refuge for man, let
us secure, as far as it is possible, our rest and habitation
there; and then we need not fear the overwhelming of the waters,
come they ever so suddenly or ever so soon; we shall be raised
above them all, unhurt and undismayed; we shall ride safely and
triumphantly over the foaming billows; and settle at last upon
the heavenly Ararat, the &ldquo;mountain of the Lord of
Hosts,&rdquo; the everlasting abode of tranquillity and
bliss.</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>But of
this happy termination we shall have occasion to speak more at
large, in another discourse; when we come to treat of the
character of Noah, and the circumstances of his wonderful
preservation.&nbsp; In the mean time, let us observe, that the
deluge is a subject of most awful consideration; not merely in
itself, as sweeping away into perdition almost all the human
race, and changing the very form and structure of the globe; but
also as being a resemblance and emblem of other visitations of an
offended and avenging God:&mdash;in the first place, of the
overthrow of Jerusalem, and the miserable and general destruction
of its rebellious people.&nbsp; &ldquo;As the days of Noe were,
so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.&nbsp; For as in
the days that were before the flood they were eating and
drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe
entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came and took
them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>man
be;&rdquo; <a name="citation53a"></a><a href="#footnote53a"
class="citation">[53a]</a> so unlooked for, so amazing, so
disastrous to His enemies.</p>
<p>This stupendous event may also be regarded as typical of
another period, infinitely surpassing all the rest in terror and
in awe;&mdash;the coming of Christ to judge the world, to execute
His final vengeance upon those who would not be reclaimed by His
mercy.&nbsp; The face of nature will then be destroyed by another
process; by a direful and universal conflagration.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth
standing out of the water and in the water: whereby the world
that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: but the
heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept
in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and
perdition of ungodly men.&rdquo; <a name="citation53b"></a><a
href="#footnote53b" class="citation">[53b]</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new
heavens and a new earth, (a new state) wherein dwelleth
righteousness.&nbsp; Wherefore, beloved, seeing that <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>ye look for
such things, be diligent that ye may be found of Him in peace,
without spot, and blameless.&rdquo; <a name="citation54a"></a><a
href="#footnote54a" class="citation">[54a]</a>&nbsp; All that
have ever lived shall be summoned again into existence; the
righteous to be separated, and &ldquo;caught up to meet the Lord
in the air,&rdquo; <a name="citation54b"></a><a
href="#footnote54b" class="citation">[54b]</a> and to be conveyed
into the regions of eternal blessedness; the wicked, to perish,
to die, not a bodily but a spiritual death; to be consigned
together to a place of banishment and wretchedness and horror and
despair.&nbsp; The miserable unbelievers and the obstinate
transgressors, in the days of Noah, shall then return to the
earth from which they were swept away; not to enjoy again their
revelry and licentiousness; not to be favoured with another day
of grace; but to receive, with all their companions in evil, with
all that have ever &ldquo;followed their pernicious ways,&rdquo;
the full and eternal recompence of their deeds.&nbsp; This will
indeed be a day of desolation, &ldquo;of lamentation and mourning
and woe,&rdquo; of &ldquo;weeping and wailing <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>and gnashing
of teeth;&rdquo; of which awful day no words, no example, no past
event, nor even imagination itself, can afford an adequate
representation.</p>
<p>God Almighty grant, that we may never know its terrors; that
we may profit from the warnings and experience, which are
mercifully vouchsafed unto us; may embrace, with all our hearts,
the covenant of salvation into which we have professedly entered;
and, amidst the wreck and ruin of the world, may be delivered
with an everlasting deliverance, for the sake, and through the
merits, of that omnipotent Saviour, who was with Noah in the ark;
who has guarded, and will continue to guard, the ark of His
Church in all ages; whose mercy and truth are pledged for the
final preservation of His faithful people: God Almighty grant
this blessing unto us all, through the aid and operation of that
&ldquo;Holy Spirit, whereby we are sealed unto the day of
redemption.&rdquo; <a name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"

<h2><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>SERMON
IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PRESERVATION FROM THE
FLOOD.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Genesis</span> vi. 8.<br />
<i>Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a former discourse, your
attention was called to the execution of divine vengeance upon
the sinful race of man, by the tremendous visitation of a
universal deluge; I would now direct your contemplation to
another point of view; to a fulfilment of the gracious promises
of God made to a distinguished believer and a faithful servant;
to his preservation from the general ruin; to the covenants of
mercy established with him; to the blessings and deliverances
thus proclaimed and typified to the Church of God in all
ages.</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Noah,
be it first observed, was possessed of that principle, which is
the sure and only foundation of true righteousness; and to which
the Almighty has, in every age, manifested His especial
favour&mdash;the principle of <i>faith</i>; of a settled, vital,
influential belief in the sovereignty, the providence, and the
word of God: he doubted not the truth either of a threatening or
a promise, and withheld not the obedience, which his belief
implied or required.&nbsp; Of this St. Paul assures us; &ldquo;By
faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved
with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the
which he condemned the world, and became heir of the
righteousness which is by faith;&rdquo; <a
name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a> he condemned the world, inasmuch as his
example, his preaching, and his deliverance furnished matter of
accusation against them; he pointed out and led the way to a
place of safety; he escaped destruction, and the rest of <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the people
might have escaped also; and thus he proved, that they justly
perished in the unbelief and obstinacy of their hearts.&nbsp;
Hence he became the heir of those promises and that happiness, to
which the righteous believer, by God&rsquo;s mercy, is entitled;
he was blessed, not merely with that temporal preservation, which
the ark afforded him in the flood; but also with that spiritual
and heavenly salvation, of which the ark was an emblem and a
sign.</p>
<p>And further; Noah is described, in the verse following the
text, as &ldquo;a just man and perfect in his
generations.&rdquo;&nbsp; His faith, as we have already
intimated, was not, like that of many professors of religion, a
mere outward and formal assent; it resided in his heart, as well
as in his understanding; and shewed itself in his disposition,
his character, and his life.&nbsp; Believing in the goodness of
God, he loved Him; in the power and justice of God, he feared; in
the infallible truth and authority of God, he <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>obeyed.&nbsp;
With an enlightened reason and conscience, he studied the duty of
ordinary life; his duty to God and man; and he performed it
faithfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was perfect in his
generations;&rdquo; not that he had attained unto absolute,
positive perfection; for that is impossible to any mere man, in
his fallen condition; it was only &ldquo;the man Christ
Jesus,&rdquo; the incarnate God, that was &ldquo;holy, harmless,
undefiled, separate from sinners;&rdquo; <a
name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59"
class="citation">[59]</a> but Noah, in the midst of a
&ldquo;disobedient and gainsaying people,&rdquo; was sincere and
upright; he lived in no wilful or habitual opposition to his God;
he had that degree of perfection, which is the mark and fruit of
genuine faith; and shews, that the frail creature is brought into
a state of acceptance with his Creator.&nbsp; He engaged heartily
in the cause of religion; there was nothing in the world, which
he was not ready to renounce for it; there was no ordinance, nor
command of God, which it was not his unbending <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>purpose to
obey; desirous was he &ldquo;to serve Him, in holiness and
righteousness all the days of his life.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
therefore it is yet further said, that &ldquo;he walked with
God;&rdquo; <a name="citation60a"></a><a href="#footnote60a"
class="citation">[60a]</a> &ldquo;setting the Lord (as David
speaks) always before him;&rdquo; <a name="citation60b"></a><a
href="#footnote60b" class="citation">[60b]</a> living in a
perpetual sense of the divine presence; acting as under the
continual observation of that Almighty Being, who was acquainted
with all his ways; and whose word was &ldquo;a lamp unto his feet
and a light unto his path.&rdquo; <a name="citation60c"></a><a
href="#footnote60c" class="citation">[60c]</a>&nbsp; He walked in
communion with God, by his life and conversation, as well as by
faith, and meditation, and prayer; and he preached to a
&ldquo;backsliding and stubborn generation,&rdquo; by his example
as well as by his word.</p>
<p>We cannot wonder, that such eminent holiness and obedience,
shining forth in the midst of so much profligacy and corruption,
were honoured with the signal favour of Almighty God.&nbsp; A
righteous character, which is always <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>&ldquo;of great price in the sight of
God,&rdquo; is peculiarly honourable in an age overspread with
impiety and guilt.&nbsp; The man, who stands forth to maintain
the cause of God against a universal host of enemies; who is
untainted by the moral contagion which is every where diffused
around him; who perseveringly opposes the mighty stream of
iniquity, which is ready to overwhelm his soul; that man is a
spectacle for angels to behold with joy; and one in whom the holy
God Himself is well-pleased; he is as &ldquo;a light shining in a
dark place,&rdquo; made more conspicuous and attractive by the
surrounding gloom.&nbsp; Such was Noah; and God distinguished him
accordingly by especial tokens of favour and blessing: for He
said, &ldquo;Behold I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon
the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life,
from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall
die.&nbsp; But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou
shalt come into the ark, thou, <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy
sons&rsquo; wives with thee.&rdquo; <a name="citation62a"></a><a
href="#footnote62a" class="citation">[62a]</a></p>
<p>A question has been raised respecting the nature of the
covenant here intended; but the words themselves, taken in
connexion with the subject, would lead us to conclude, that the
covenant to be established, in the first instance, was a covenant
of safety in the ark, during the flood; and this sense is
abundantly confirmed by the same word being afterwards used in
the 9th chapter, when God made His promise to the patriarch, that
the world should never again be so destroyed: &ldquo;Behold, I
establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you, and
with every living creature that is with you&mdash;neither shall
all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither
shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation62b"></a><a href="#footnote62b"
class="citation">[62b]</a>&nbsp; Yet, though this was the
immediate import of the covenant, it probably had, like the ark
itself, a further and a typical <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>signification, which is thus very
admirably expressed by one of the best commentators; &ldquo;I
will most certainly make good the promise I have formerly made to
thee, of preserving thee and thy family from the said
destruction; and further I will make good, in due time, to thee
or thy seed after thee, <i>all</i> those covenants or promises,
which I have made to mankind from the beginning of the world, and
which remain to be made good; especially the grand covenant
concerning the promised seed, of Messiah: to which end, I will
certainly preserve thee and thy family from the destruction I am
now bringing on the rest of mankind.&rdquo; <a
name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63"
class="citation">[63]</a></p>
<p>The first covenant made by God with Adam, was a covenant of
works, of unsinning obedience; this was broken, and thence came
death.&nbsp; The second covenant made with Adam, was that of
grace and salvation by Jesus Christ, who should &ldquo;come in
the fulness of time;&rdquo; this latter <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>covenant was
confirmed with Noah, the representative of mankind in the new
world after the flood; and the covenant, thus renewed with him,
was to extend to all his posterity; to generations unborn, to all
that would become, as he was, &ldquo;heirs of the righteousness
which is by faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; Through him, deliverance was
preached to the people before the flood; through him, everlasting
deliverance from sin and death was promised to believers in every
future age.&nbsp; In the covenant, therefore, made with Noah, all
mankind have an interest, an especial interest at this day; the
promised deliverer, whom Noah represented, is come; we
&ldquo;have seen the salvation of our God;&rdquo; the gospel of
peace is proclaimed; and nothing is wanting but our faithful
acceptance of it.</p>
<p>Proceed we now with the history of Noah&rsquo;s preservation:
&ldquo;The waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth (a hundred
and fifty days), and all the high hills, that were under the
whole heaven, were covered&mdash;and all flesh <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>died that
moved upon the earth, Noah only remained alive, and they that
were with him in the ark.&nbsp; And the ark rested in the seventh
month, upon the mountains of Ararat.&rdquo; <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a>&nbsp; Thus was the divine promise
literally fulfilled, and the fidelity of the patriarch signally
acknowledged and rewarded.&nbsp; What must have been the emotions
of this holy man, as he was floating, through the long eventful
period, upon the surface of the raging waters!&nbsp; How deep and
lively his conviction of the adorable goodness and the perfect
truth of God!&nbsp; How fervent his gratitude, how sublime his
joy, at escaping unhurt amid the desolation of the world!&nbsp;
How indescribable his feelings of horror and of awe, at the
sufferings of those countless multitudes, who were perishing
around him; over whose lifeless bodies he was riding in peaceful
security, reserved to be the father of a new-born world!&nbsp;
Similar to these are the impressions of every sincere believer,
<a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>on
beholding both the providential and spiritual dispensations of
the Lord.&nbsp; Deeply is he convinced of the &ldquo;goodness and
severity of God;&rdquo; of His goodness to the righteous, His
severity to the disobedient and evil: Every divine promise and
every denunciation of divine judgment have been fully
accomplished in due season; &ldquo;not one jot or one tittle of
the word of God has failed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Christian, moreover,
by his own experience, can testify the truth and loving kindness
of God: he has sought and found a refuge in the ark of salvation,
in the gospel of peace; he has been taken out of a corrupt and
troubled world, and raised above it; so that, while the billows
of adversity have been rolling all around, and the overbearings
of iniquity have every where prevailed, he has felt himself in a
state of security; inclosed by divine mercy &ldquo;on the right
hand and on the left;&rdquo; protected by the power of Jehovah;
all things, even the most unruly elements, &ldquo;working
together for his good:&rdquo; when &ldquo;the rain descends, and
<a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>the floods
come, and the winds blow,&rdquo; he hears and sees it all without
dismay; nay, with gratitude to his heavenly Preserver; hoping and
believing, that the waves of trouble are bearing him to the
celestial Ararat, upon which he shall alight, in God&rsquo;s
appointed time, and &ldquo;find rest unto his soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, in the midst of his satisfaction and joy, there is a
consideration, which strikes a damp upon his soul, and fills him
with grief and terror; it is, the miserable condition of those
his fellow-creatures, who have been regardless of their salvation
and have perished: the Saviour &ldquo;called, but they would not
answer;&rdquo; He assured them of the coming desolation, but they
would not take heed; He offered them mercy, but they turned away:
and the flood came upon them unawares; and it is painful to think
of them, where they now are, and how many they have been.&nbsp;
And not only for those who are gone, but for numbers still
living, does the charitable Christian also feel: it is not for
him to <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>be
forward in judging, not for him to condemn; &ldquo;he hopeth all
things, and believeth all things;&rdquo; but when he sees
multitudes around him manifestly walking in the &ldquo;broad way
of destruction,&rdquo; he cannot help feeling both pity and pain;
especially if any of his neighbours or friends be found in this
awful state of heedlessness and sin; especially if any who are
near and dear unto him.&nbsp; He cannot help grieving for them;
they will have, at least, his tears and his prayers.&nbsp; Would
that such sinners might feel for themselves, what others feel for
them; would that they might turn and live!&nbsp; Their case is
not like the case of those who were perishing in the flood; they
are not yet consigned to destruction; would to God that they
might turn and live!</p>
<p>At length, &ldquo;the waters were dried up from off the earth,
and the face of the ground was dry.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And Noah
went forth&rdquo; out of the ark, and &ldquo;builded an altar
unto the Lord, and offered burnt <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>offerings upon the altar,&rdquo; in
thanksgiving for his miraculous preservation; &ldquo;and the Lord
smelled a sweet savour;&rdquo; <a name="citation69"></a><a
href="#footnote69" class="citation">[69]</a> He accepted the
incense of the sacrifice, approved and honoured the piety and
gratitude of Noah.</p>
<p>In all our deliverances and escapes, in all the benefits and
blessings we receive at the merciful hands of God, let us never
fail to imitate this bright example of righteousness: be it our
first, our immediate act, to waft unto the skies the incense of
adoration and praise.&nbsp; The faithful and observant Christian
does indeed perpetually notice the interposition of divine
Providence in his behalf; and he never fails to render the
tribute of his heart at least, if not of his lips, to the great
Deliverer: but besides this, there are few of us, who have not,
in some striking instances, been wonderfully rescued from
imminent danger and destruction; preserved in frightful accident,
or raised from a sickness which was seemingly <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>unto
death.&nbsp; Has the favour been duty remembered with
gratitude?&nbsp; Did it bring us on our knees before the throne
of mercy?&nbsp; Did we present our offering with that humble
sense of our own unworthiness, and that devout acknowledgment of
God&rsquo;s love, which gave us just reason to believe that the
offering was accepted, through Jesus Christ our Lord?&nbsp; And
ever since, has an altar been raised in our hearts; have our
affections been dedicated to God, as a memorial of the past
deliverance, and a fulfilment of the purpose for which we were
mercifully spared?</p>
<p>And there is a deliverance greater and mightier than all, of
which every faithful servant in the gospel is enjoying, at once,
both the hope and the benefit; a deliverance, of which
Noah&rsquo;s was a type, from the bondage and penalty of sin;
from eternal misery, and ruin.&nbsp; Are we penetrated with a
sense of this marvellous mercy?&nbsp; Do we worship our great
Redeemer in spirit and in truth?&nbsp; Do we <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>love Him with
all our heart and soul?&nbsp; Do we proclaim abroad our gratitude
and love, in the presence of a contemptuous world?&nbsp; Noah was
immediately and powerfully reminded of the divine goodness
accorded to himself, by beholding the face of nature all desolate
and void: and thus, when we behold around us the dismal ravages
of sin, and contemplate, with the eye of faith, the ruin which
they will finally bring, are there not afforded to <i>us</i>,
exulting as we are in the hope of our own redemption, abundant
memorials of the favour of God to ourselves?&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless
the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy
name.&nbsp; Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His
benefits: who redeemeth thy life from destruction, and crowneth
thee with loving kindness and tender mercies.&rdquo; <a
name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a></p>
<p>My brethren, if we would find, as &ldquo;Noah found, grace in
the eyes of the Lord,&rdquo; we must be like him, in faith and
obedience, in &ldquo;faith which worketh by love.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>We must be
ready, at the divine command, to leave the &ldquo;pomps and
vanity of a wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the
flesh,&rdquo; and prepare the means of our deliverance, in the
way which God mercifully points out.&nbsp; We must dare to be
singular in the midst of a gainsaying and reviling people; and
maintain our integrity in the face of a backsliding age.&nbsp;
If, in the hour of danger and destruction, we would have God for
our deliverer and friend, we must seek Him and serve Him, whilst
we are in health and safety: thus will He be our portion in life,
in death, in judgment, and for ever.</p>
<p>We are hereby led, in the last place, to consider the promise
and pledge, which God was pleased to afford to the patriarch
immediately after the flood; that &ldquo;the waters would no more
become a flood to destroy all flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I do set
my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant
between me and the earth&mdash;and I will look upon it, that I
may remember the everlasting covenant between God <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>and every
living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whether there had ever been a rainbow before the flood, is a
point that cannot absolutely be determined; probably not; but if
there had been, it makes no difference; the bow was then
consecrated to be the token of a covenant of mercy, between God
and man; and whenever the descending shower and the darkened sky
recal to mind his former vengeance on the ungodly, we may take
comfort on beholding this bright display of majesty and beauty,
&ldquo;this faithful witness in heaven;&rdquo; <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a> our hearts may then be gladdened by the
remembrance and assurance of God&rsquo;s everlasting love: we
behold the seal of heaven, ratifying the promise of divine
favour: and the believer may justly regard it, not only as a
token of security against a future deluge, but also as a hopeful
intimation of God&rsquo;s mercy in all the storms of this mortal
life, in every threatening flood.&nbsp; We may view it, with
delighted eyes, as a blessed <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>memorial of the truth and
faithfulness of that Almighty Protector, whose word is pledged
for the preservation of His people, at all times and under all
possible circumstances.&nbsp; His mercies, of providence and
grace, can never fail; and an earnest of these mercies we may
discover, when we look upon the bow in the cloud; it is, in a
secondary sense at least, emblematical of God&rsquo;s everlasting
covenant with His faithful people, that He will &ldquo;never
leave them nor forsake them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor is it without authority, that we are thus extending the
import of this heavenly sign: St. John in one of his beatific
visions, &ldquo;looked and behold a door was opened in heaven,
and behold a throne was set in heaven, and there was a rainbow
round about the throne.&rdquo; <a name="citation75"></a><a
href="#footnote75" class="citation">[75]</a>&nbsp; The saints in
light are thus represented as beholding the abode of their God,
encircled with the token of His covenanted mercy; an evidence to
them, that they have finally escaped the devastation of the
world; <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>that the floods and storms have for ever subsided; that
none of the imperfections and troubles and dangers, from which
they have been rescued, shall ever again disturb their mind or
mar their happiness.</p>
<p>Hear then, in few words, the conclusion of the whole matter:
let the destroying deluge awaken in us, by divine grace, a living
conviction of the infallibility of God&rsquo;s word, of the
certain &ldquo;perdition of ungodly men;&rdquo; let the
deliverance of Noah and his family assure our hearts in the
expectation of the glorious redemption of every believer and
servant of God.</p>
<p>Let us enter the ark of salvation, prepared by our great
Redeemer; enter and abide there; and we shall be carried
triumphantly over the stormy elements of the world; and be
conducted &ldquo;unto the haven where we would be:&rdquo; the
dove will bring unto us the olive branch of peace; and the
transcendent beauty of the celestial rainbow shall appear without
a cloud, and bless our souls with the perfect assurance of
eternal safety and joy.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">DO THIS GREAT WICKEDNESS AND SIN AGAINST
GOD.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Genesis</span> xxxix. 9.</p>
<p><i>How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against
God</i>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of Joseph, by whom
these memorable words were uttered, is full of interest and
instruction.&nbsp; He presents unto us the splendid and rare
example of a person advanced, from the lowest estate, to
distinction and wealth and power; and yet preserving his piety
and integrity unimpaired.&nbsp; Not all the luxury and
blandishments of a court of unbelievers could tempt him to forget
that gracious almighty benefactor, by whom he had been rescued
from danger, and raised to prosperity and <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>greatness.&nbsp; We all know how apt are the
understanding and heart of man to be captivated and corrupted by
the enjoyment of earthly pomp and pleasure, under any
circumstances; but especially when they are attained by a sudden
and unexpected elevation.&nbsp; Joseph had been cruelly left by
his brethren in a state of utter destitution.&nbsp; Taken out of
the pit into which they had inhumanly cast him, he was sold as a
slave to a company of people, who were passing by, and carried
into Egypt; by accident, as it appeared, but really under the
guidance and direction of an all-wise providence, to accomplish
the wonderful purposes of His divine will.</p>
<p>The scriptural account of his rapid rise to favour and
eminence, in this his new abode, is exceedingly striking; and
shews the especial regard which the Almighty bears for His
righteous and faithful servants; there is no situation of life
too obscure for the notice of His all-seeing eye; none too low
for Him to interpose in <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>behalf of His people, and exalt them
to usefulness and honour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Joseph was brought down to
Egypt; and Potiphar an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard,
an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which
had brought him down thither.&nbsp; And the Lord was with Joseph,
and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his
master the Egyptian.&nbsp; And his master saw that the Lord was
with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in
his hand.&nbsp; And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he
served him; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that
he had he put into his hand.&rdquo; <a name="citation78"></a><a
href="#footnote78" class="citation">[78]</a></p>
<p>Thus favoured and advanced, this holy man never forgot, as too
many do, that gracious Being, to whose loving kindness he was
indebted; instead of growing vain of his superiority, as if he
had raised himself merely by his own talent or industry, he
referred all his blessings to God&rsquo;s bountiful providence,
and rendered unto <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>Him the return of a grateful and faithful service.</p>
<p>It was not long before his fidelity was put to the trial; and
the manner in which he escaped the snare, that was laid for him,
affords a remarkable proof not only of his integrity, but of his
faith, his piety, his religion, his gratitude and love to God:
the only principles upon which any dependence can be placed in
the temptation of an evil hour.&nbsp; Joseph, when powerfully
solicited to betray the confidence, and despoil the honour of his
master, might have contented himself with declaring the
numberless acts of kindness which he had received at
Potiphar&rsquo;s hand; the recompence of faithfulness which he
owed for them all; or the fear of bringing upon himself disgrace
and ruin, by so atrocious a crime; considerations indeed, which
actually had no small influence and weight upon his mind.&nbsp;
But he goes much further, and appeals to a higher authority, to a
nobler principle; to one which was calculated to give unto every
minor consideration <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>a tenfold effect; to secure the performance of that
duty, which reason and honour and conscience suggested; he
appealed to his God, from the fountain of whose mercy he had
derived all his benefits and blessings; and to whom therefore,
his sincere unswerving obedience was unreservedly due.&nbsp; Like
every pious and good man, he remembers and regards the human ties
by which he is bound; and instances, in feeling language, the
kindness and estimation of his earthly master; &ldquo;Behold, my
master wrotteth not (knoweth not) what is with me in the house,
and he hath committed all things that he hath to my hand; there
is none greater in this house than I.&rdquo; <a
name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a>&nbsp; But then this man of God, after
thus recounting the signal favour which had been shewn him by an
earthly master, does not rest his duty upon saying, &lsquo;how
can I abuse the unbounded confidence reposed in me; how can I
prove myself so unworthy of my lord?&rsquo;&nbsp; But
immediately, <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>as if it were the habitual suggestion of his mind,
elevates his thoughts and affections to his master in heaven; to
Him, who had put it into the heart of Potiphar thus to
distinguish and bless him; to Him, by whose grace alone he had
been what he had been, a faithful and dutiful servant; and by
whose gracious interposition &ldquo;all things had worked
together for his good.&rdquo;&nbsp; For such surpassing mercy
poured down upon him from heaven, he could not bear the thought
of making so base a requital; and exclaimed in the energy of his
soul, &ldquo;How can I do this great wickedness and sin against
God?&rdquo;&nbsp; Resting upon such a principle, the triumph of
his virtue was complete; it enabled him to disregard whatever
evil consequences might ensue; and to stand against the subtlest
wiles of the tempter, and under circumstances of imminent peril,
a noble monument of the power of religion; upright in his duty to
God and man.</p>
<p>Much edification may the Christian gather from the narrative
before us; and <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>happy would it be for the Christian world, if the
principle, here so splendidly illustrated, were in fuller
operation.&nbsp; It might indeed be thought, that with the
superior knowledge we enjoy, of the transcendent mercy and
goodness of God, of the extent and bounty of His providence, as
well as the riches of his grace; that, with the clear revelation
of the divine will, the glorious manifestation of gospel light,
to us so abundantly vouchsafed; that, taught as we have been to
look upon God as our reconciled Father in Jesus Christ, as the
&ldquo;author and giver of every good gift&rdquo; in this world,
and the spring of all our blissful hopes of an inheritance in the
brighter world to come; it might have been thought, under these
superior advantages and means of grace, that in all the events of
life, in every temptation and trial, our affections would be
certainly raised, above every earthly consideration, to the high
and holy God; that, when we are pressed with the solicitations of
evil, it would immediately occur to our minds and enter <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>into our
hearts, how abhorrent the offence must be to that perfect and
glorious Being, in whose image we are professedly recreated; how
grievous to that Holy Spirit, in whom we ought to live and walk;
how disgracefully and basely unworthy of those spiritual
privileges, to which we have been restored; of the great mercies
we have already received; and the still greater we are yet
expecting, from the redemption which hath been wrought for us by
the ever blessed Jesus; it might be concluded, that Christians,
when tempted to injury and evil, would immediately refer the
matter to the blessed word and will of their divine master, and
exclaim, with a pious and grateful feeling, &ldquo;how can I do
this great wickedness and sin against God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, is it not notorious, that a great, an overwhelming
portion of the inhabitants of this enlightened land, are governed
in a very small, if in any degree, by this pure sense of
spiritual and religious obligation?&nbsp; Commonly, when they are
<a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>solicited
to sinful gratifications and pursuits, &ldquo;God is not in all
their thoughts:&rdquo; whether they yield or not, depends partly
upon the strength of their natural inclination; partly upon the
light in which the sin may be regarded by the world around them;
upon the extent to which it may affect their worldly reputation;
upon what they may calculate to gain or lose by their
conduct.&nbsp; The law of custom has manifestly a greater
influence than the law of God; nay, what are called the <i>rules
of honour</i>, which, in many instances, are flagrantly repugnant
and opposite to the divine will, (and might rather be called the
rules of <i>dishonour</i>,) are appealed to, in a Christian
country, as the arbiters of right and wrong; while the
&ldquo;honour that cometh from God only&rdquo; is totally
disregarded and forgotten.&nbsp; And even of those, who are
unacquainted with the precise terms of these fallacious rules,
what multitudes are there, whose practice and conduct are
determined by considerations merely human; who will be guided <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>by a feeling
of gratitude to an earthly benefactor, and yet have no sense or
remembrance of the favour of an all-merciful God; who will be
deterred from evil by the dread of offending an earthly superior,
that has power only over the body, and yet possess in their
hearts no fear whatever of Him, &ldquo;who is able to destroy
both body and soul in hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where there are no
better guides, no higher inducements than these, &ldquo;to refuse
the evil and to choose the good,&rdquo; we cannot be surprised at
the licentiousness and corruption, which so unhappily prevail;
nor even at the flagrant and shameless commission of that
calamitous sin, which Joseph rejected with such holy
disdain.&nbsp; Against the impetuous desires and cravings of the
flesh; the assiduous entreaties of wicked companions; and the
beguiling charms, which Satan so well knows how to spread over
all the ways and works of evil; against all these combining
together, it cannot be expected, that any human <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>motives or
maxims, any earthly feelings alone, should be able successfully
to stand.</p>
<p>Not that such motives or maxims or feelings are to be despised
or disregarded; not that any just or lawful consideration,
however trivial, should be overlooked, which may be instrumental,
in any degree, to preserve us from evil.&nbsp; Far is it from
being the design of the gospel, to supersede the dictates and
rules of reason; the workings of conscience; or the influence of
natural affection, of hope and joy and gratitude and love; the
gospel purifies all these motives, and guides them aright, and
directs the exercise of them into the proper channel.&nbsp; But
even the best of them, with the sincere Christian, are as nothing
when compared with his religious principle, with the faith and
fear and love of God: when tempted to sin, he thinks of that Holy
Being, with whom he has entered into covenant; of that gracious
Redeemer, who hath endured so much for his sake, who hath <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>brought him
into the way of salvation, by whose favour he is enjoying
&ldquo;the life that now is, and the promise of that which is to
come;&rdquo; he thinks of the Holy Spirit, &ldquo;by whom he has
been regenerated and made a child of grace;&rdquo; he would not
quench that sacred flame and energy, by which his corrupt nature
has been enlightened and purified; from which &ldquo;all good
desires, all good counsels, and all just works do proceed;&rdquo;
by which his soul is animated with the inspiring hope of
beholding his God face to face, in perfect righteousness and
everlasting glory.&nbsp; He loves to please, he cannot bear the
thought of offending, the Lord of majesty and mercy; and looks to
Him for strength in the hour of trial.&nbsp; The constant habit
of thus lifting up, in the spirit of prayer, the thoughts and
affections to God; the full and abiding persuasion of His
manifold mercies to the faithful, of His terrible judgments to be
executed upon the disobedient and the impenitent <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>sinner, will
always be found the surest, the only sure, preservative from
sin.</p>
<p>And how can that man, who believes, with all his heart and
soul, in the glorious revelation of the Gospel; in the miseries
which he may thereby escape, and the happiness which he may
attain; in the means ordained for his accomplishment of these
momentous purposes; how can he fail or cease to maintain a lively
remembrance of the goodness and wisdom and power of God?&nbsp;
Will he not &ldquo;set the Lord alway before him;&rdquo; and
under the countenance and protection of his Saviour, and in the
awful presence of his Judge, will he not feel himself powerfully
actuated to restrain and resist every guilty inclination, and to
decline from the danger and dishonour of every evil way?&nbsp;
&ldquo;How can I do this great wickedness and sin against&rdquo;
my Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier&mdash;the Almighty God,
whose I am, and whom I serve?</p>
<p>This reflection is also calculated to excite <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>our attention
to the duties of this holy season, <a name="citation89a"></a><a
href="#footnote89a" class="citation">[89a]</a> prescribed by the
Church for our christian improvement; the duties of
self-examination and repentance.&nbsp; Convinced, that every
wilful sin renders us unworthy of acceptance with that God,
&ldquo;who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,&rdquo; let
us retire into our chamber and take our private hour, and cast a
searching eye over our character and life, intent upon
discovering every stain and blemish; let us &ldquo;see if there
be any wicked way in us,&rdquo; and pray fervently to be
&ldquo;led into the way everlasting.&rdquo; <a
name="citation89b"></a><a href="#footnote89b"
class="citation">[89b]</a>&nbsp; Let the sinfulness of our
condition by nature, the sinfulness of our thoughts and words and
works, pass in review before us; nor let the soul ever rest
content, till we have made our peace with God;&mdash;by an humble
abasement under the sense of our undeservings; by unfeigned
sorrow for the past; by a holy, steady, entire resolution, to
watch more carefully, and walk more circumspectly; by laying
aside <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;every weight, and the sin which doth so easily
beset us.&rdquo; <a name="citation90a"></a><a href="#footnote90a"
class="citation">[90a]</a></p>
<p>When we duly think of the long-suffering and forbearance of
our offended Father; of His great mercy in &ldquo;sparing us when
we deserved punishment;&rdquo; sparing us to repent of our faults
and follies, to advance in holiness and righteousness, to further
the everlasting interest of the soul; surely we shall then be
penetrated with a deep sense of the divine compassion; and the
goodness of God &ldquo;will answer its blessed purpose and lead
us to repentance.&rdquo; <a name="citation90b"></a><a
href="#footnote90b" class="citation">[90b]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;How
can I persist in abusing the patience which has borne with me so
long?&nbsp; How shall I continue to neglect any duty, which so
merciful a God has commanded, for the edification and salvation
of my soul?&nbsp; How shall I rebelliously cherish any sinful
indulgence, which is opposed to His holy law; and thus forfeit my
claim to that heavenly inheritance, which my Saviour has died to
procure for the true believer, for the penitent and contrite <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>in
heart?&nbsp; How can I do less than abhor the sin, which His
blood was shed to expiate and cleanse away; less, than delight
and advance in the way of righteousness which He has opened to
me;&rsquo; even till &ldquo;I come unto the measure of the
stature of the fulness of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reflections, deliberations, resolutions such as these,
sincerely formed and cherished, would very effectually, by divine
grace, assist us in attaining that disposition of mind and heart,
which might lead us habitually to raise our thoughts to God,
under every circumstance, and at every time of temptation.&nbsp;
There would thus be cast around us a sacred wall of defence; a
perpetual barrier against the inroads of Satan and of sin; and if
at times they should, when we are suddenly thrown off our guard,
break in upon the heart and lay it waste, they would speedily be
expelled, and the breach would be healed without delay.&nbsp;
Thus we shall become more jealous over ourselves, more
circumspect and watchful; we shall never <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>feel easy,
while betraying, into the hands of the enemy, the merciful and
glorious work of God.&nbsp; With a love for His goodness, a
reverence for His truth, and a fear of His judgments, abiding in
the heart, we shall fly from every approach of evil, and dwell in
safety beneath the shadow of His wing: &ldquo;we shall be enabled
to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to
stand.&rdquo; <a name="citation92"></a><a href="#footnote92"
class="citation">[92]</a></p>
<p>It is our distinguished privilege to be enlightened by the
&ldquo;wisdom which is from above,&rdquo; to &ldquo;be strong in
the Lord, and in the power of His might:&rdquo; God forbid that
we should return to the &ldquo;beggarly elements of the
world,&rdquo; and seek to draw our principles and strength from
this polluted source.&nbsp; Had we never been blessed with the
light of revelation, we must have been content with such means of
duty, as our dark state afforded: we must have been governed and
guided like the heathen, whom we now pity.&nbsp; But, as we are
supremely favoured with the <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>knowledge of the true God, as
&ldquo;our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus
Christ;&rdquo; as the Holy Spirit is given to &ldquo;help our
infirmities;&rdquo; let us, in every temptation, remember our
infinite obligations to the great and merciful Jehovah, and trust
in the sufficiency of His almighty power.</p>
<p>After thus &ldquo;walking with God as friends;&rdquo; having,
for the sake of His friendship, struggled with our evil
propensities; having despised the vanity and folly, and renounced
the love of the world, we shall experience more and more, the
value of His favour, and the fulness of His grace; serving Him in
humble gratitude, we shall be acknowledged as His own peculiar
people, and He will be our God; in all perplexities we shall find
Him our guide, in all trouble our comfort and support; amid the
crooked paths of vice He will &ldquo;make our way plain before
His face;&rdquo; the &ldquo;snare will be broken and we shall be
delivered;&rdquo; He will honour us among men; &ldquo;such honour
have <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>all
His saints;&rdquo; and this will be an earnest of our everlasting
honour in His heavenly abode, in perfect friendship and communion
with Him, in that blessed place where sin and temptation will be
no more, &ldquo;where nothing that defileth can enter.&rdquo;</p>

VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON THE JOURNEY TO EMMAUS.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Luke</span> xxiv. 32.&nbsp;
<i>And they said one to another</i>, <i>Did not our heart burn
within us</i>, <i>while He talked with us by the way</i>, <i>and
while He opened to us the Scriptures</i>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a portion of one of those
affecting and instructive pieces of history, with which the
sacred scriptures every where abound.</p>
<p>After the resurrection of Jesus, on the very same day, two of
His disciples were journeying together to a village called
Emmaus, a few miles distant from Jerusalem.&nbsp; And as they
went, &ldquo;they talked together of those things which had
happened.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>And certainly never was there
furnished to disciples an occasion of more interesting
conversation.&nbsp; They were at no loss for a subject; their
feelings were deeply moved, their circumstances most peculiar;
they had just been bereaved of their Lord; and were left, as they
thought, helpless and hopeless upon the wide world: they had been
attending the sad scene of His sufferings; and doubtless had been
witnessing his awful crucifixion; abundance of matter therefore,
was afforded them for reflection and discourse.&nbsp; But besides
this, they had heard the report of their Lord&rsquo;s
resurrection; and as they did not at all understand the purport
of it, appeared indeed scarcely to believe an event so
extraordinary, they were probably consulting what to expect, or
what to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it came to pass, that, while they
communed together and reasoned, Jesus Himself drew near, and went
with them.&nbsp; But their eyes were holden, that they should not
know Him.&rdquo; <a name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a>&nbsp; Either <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>He assumed a different form, or He
supernaturally influenced their sight, that they should not at
first recognize Him.</p>
<p>Jesus, let us observe, appeared to the disciples, while they
were engaged in holy meditation and converse; and thus, though no
longer visible in the world, He may still be expected, at all
times, to favour His true disciples in a similar manner.&nbsp;
While they are conversing upon the things belonging to His
kingdom, upon the wonders of His love, and the riches of His
grace, upon their high privileges and expectations, upon the
doctrines and precepts of His holy word, upon the duties and
experiences of their earthly pilgrimage, upon their walk with God
here, and their hope of dwelling together with Him for ever
hereafter; while they are musing and discoursing of these things,
the blessed Jesus will join company with them, though unknown and
unseen; and will shed over their conference a holy and heavenly
benediction.&nbsp; A reproach it is to vast numbers <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>of His
professing disciples, that they are not more anxious to embrace
such opportunities of enjoying the favour and presence of their
Lord; that many, even intimate friends and near relations, amid
the endless variety of their subjects of conversation, are
scarcely ever found to exchange a sentiment or a word, upon the
most interesting and important of all topics; the love of their
Lord and the edification of their souls.&nbsp; Eagerly do they
embrace every opportunity of ministering to the passing
amusement, or the temporal welfare, of each other; the only
subject, which appears to be forbidden ground, is the subject of
an eternal life to come, their spiritual well-being here and
hereafter.</p>
<p>But let me not be misunderstood on this point; I am not
speaking of the promiscuous intercourse of society; not of
religious discussions or allusions amid the ordinary business of
life; not of that irreverent and dangerous habit, into which same
believers have been incautiously <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>betrayed, of detailing to one another
their continual and familiar experiences; I am speaking of the
private and sober communing of christian friends, who are
dwelling together, or journeying together, as the disciples to
Emmaus: and truly, &ldquo;with the bible in their hands and the
Saviour in their hearts,&rdquo; it is wonderful how they can
forbear from spiritual intercourse.&nbsp; If the everlasting
truths of the gospel have made a deep impression upon their
minds; if, for the promises therein revealed, it is their object
to live and to die; if they have one common hope of their
calling, &ldquo;one thing needful&rdquo; which occupies their
affections; if they have the same exalted view of a glorious
kingdom in heaven; if they are living together in love, and
comforting themselves, that the holy bond shall never be broken,
that it shall be renewed in a happier world and last for ever;
then it would be strange if their thoughts and their conversation
should never turn upon a subject of such overwhelming interest;
upon a topic so abundantly <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>fruitful in materials for mutual
edification.&nbsp; The idea of the Lord being present with us in
our conferences is an animating and ennobling idea: but we cannot
expect His holy presence in the scenes of vanity and frivolity;
nor can we expect it at any time, if the thought and desire of
Him be altogether excluded.&nbsp; From the cold moralist, or the
worldly-minded disciple, from those who have no practical concern
for the gospel or for their souls, we need not look for a word of
spiritual communication; it is abhorrent to their feelings and
inconsistent with their notions; but the sincere Christian should
&ldquo;think on these things.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The world will
love its own,&rdquo; and follow its own; its own friends and
maxims and ways: but &ldquo;we are not of the world,&rdquo; and
better fruit is expected from us.</p>
<p>But to return to the history before us.&nbsp; Having listened
for a time to the earnest discourse of the disciples, Jesus at
length, as if a stranger, enquired into the subject, which
engrossed their minds and rendered them so sorrowful: &ldquo;And
the one of <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>them whose name was Cleopas, (the same, it is thought,
as Alpheus, who was the father of two Apostles and nearly related
to our Lord Himself,) answering, said unto Him, art thou only a
stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things, which are
come to pass there in these days?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And he said
unto them what things?&rdquo; said it, probably, with a view of
giving them an opportunity of declaring their opinions, upon what
had taken place, as also upon Himself and the nature of His
kingdom: &ldquo;and they said unto Him, concerning Jesus of
Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word, before God
and all the people: and how the chief priests and our rulers
delivered Him to be condemned to death, and have crucified
Him.&nbsp; But we trusted, that it had been He who should have
redeemed Israel; and beside all this, to-day is the third day
since these things were done.&rdquo; <a name="citation101"></a><a
href="#footnote101" class="citation">[101]</a>&nbsp; They
concluded, that their bright hopes of redemption were
extinguished, were all <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>dead and buried with Jesus: even
though they had heard of His rising again, according to His own
promise, which they had just alluded to, still they had no
expectation of holding any further intercourse with Him, of any
further display of His power in their behalf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he said unto them, O fools (O unwise and blinded
people) and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have
spoken; ought not Christ (ought not your Messiah prophesied of
old) to have suffered these things and enter into His
glory?&rdquo; <a name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102"
class="citation">[102]</a>&nbsp; Is it not clearly foretold by
your prophets, by Isaiah especially in his 53d chapter, that the
redeemer of Israel should be &ldquo;despised and rejected of
men,&rdquo; should bear &ldquo;their griefs and carry their
sorrows,&rdquo; &ldquo;should be led as a lamb to the slaughter,
should be numbered with the transgressors,&rdquo; should make
&ldquo;His grave with the wicked (should die with malefactors)
and with the rich in his death,&rdquo; (should be buried in the
sepulchre of the rich,) and <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>after that &ldquo;prolong His
days,&rdquo; and then that &ldquo;the pleasure of the Lord should
prosper in His hand?&rdquo;&nbsp; According to your own
prophecies then, and in order to their fulfilment, has not Jesus
done that, as Messiah, which He was required to do?&nbsp; Instead
of being offended, and giving up the cause, ye ought to be fully
convinced, that He is &ldquo;the Christ, the son of the living
God.&rdquo; <a name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a"
class="citation">[103a]</a>&nbsp; Then, &ldquo;beginning at Moses
and all the prophets, He expounded to them in all the sacred
scriptures the things concerning Himself.&rdquo; <a
name="citation103b"></a><a href="#footnote103b"
class="citation">[103b]</a>&nbsp; How enlightening and convincing
must this discourse have been!&nbsp; But it is not preserved to
us: with so complete a body of information and evidence, it did
not please the Almighty to favour the world.&nbsp; We are left to
gather the instruction by diligent observation and study; and
thankful may we be, that there still remain most abundant sources
of satisfactory knowledge on this head; that the prophecies and
types of the Saviour in the Old <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>Testament, when compared with their
fulfilment, are sufficiently clear for the conviction of every
honest and well-disposed mind.</p>
<p>After this, the disciples &ldquo;drew nigh unto the village
whither they went; and Jesus made as though He would have gone
further.&nbsp; But they constrained Him, saying, Abide with us;
for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.&nbsp; And He
went in to tarry with them.&rdquo; <a name="citation104a"></a><a
href="#footnote104a" class="citation">[104a]</a>&nbsp; And thus
He still favours His disciples, and will do as long as the world
stands; when they heartily desire His abiding presence, it will
never be denied; wherever the place or whatever the occasion,
their Lord, if wished for and welcome, will be of their company:
in the domestic circle, in the converse of friends, in the sacred
hour of solitude; &ldquo;when thou sittest in thine house, and
when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when
thou risest up.&rdquo; <a name="citation104b"></a><a
href="#footnote104b" class="citation">[104b]</a>&nbsp; We have
only to lift our thoughts to Him; &ldquo;to set Him <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>always
before us; and He will be at our right hand, that we shall not be
moved.&rdquo; <a name="citation105a"></a><a href="#footnote105a"
class="citation">[105a]</a>&nbsp; At all times He will be found
&ldquo;a present help;&rdquo; but especially when we are
associated or assembled in remembrance of Him.&nbsp; Such is the
promise of His word: &ldquo;where two or three are gathered
together in my name, there am I in the midst of them:&rdquo; <a
name="citation105b"></a><a href="#footnote105b"
class="citation">[105b]</a> gathered together for consultation,
for worship, for any holy purpose.</p>
<p>Jesus, when He had entered into the house with the two
disciples, acted in a manner which served to bring Him to their
knowledge: &ldquo;As He sat at meat with them, He took bread and
blessed it, and brake and gave to them; (though a supposed
stranger, He appeared as the head of the family; blessing and
distributing, as His custom had been at their ordinary meals:)
And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him: And He vanished
out of their sight;&rdquo; <a name="citation105c"></a><a
href="#footnote105c" class="citation">[105c]</a> immediately left
them to ponder upon the amazing things which they had
heard.&nbsp; <a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&ldquo;And they said one to another, Did not our heart
burn within us, while He talked with us by the way, and while He
opened to us the Scriptures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cleopas and his friend were unquestionably favoured beyond the
common lot of disciples: to hear the sacred oracles explained by
Him, who was at once the subject and fulfilment of them; by Him,
through whose spirit the prophets and holy men of old all spake;
to hear them perfectly explained and illustrated by the voice of
the Son of God, might well make a vivid impression upon their
minds, and fill their bosom with fervent and rapturous delight:
Yet, though we cannot be so singularly blessed, there may be
communicated to us a measure of that knowledge, which these
disciples enjoyed; there may be imparted to us no inconsiderable
portion of the same holy animation.</p>
<p>Our merciful Lord, on withdrawing His visible presence from
this world, sent, according to His promise, another Comforter; a
Comforter, who should &ldquo;guide <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>His people into all truth;&rdquo;
should &ldquo;give them a right judgment in all things,&rdquo;
and spread a holy influence over their affections and
desires.&nbsp; And now, when we are reading His word, when musing
upon it with devout meditation, and conversing with one another
upon its exalted truths, its heavenly purposes, its abundant
promises and blessings; and now, when we hear the word from the
lips of those ministers, who, however unworthy in themselves, are
commissioned to speak in His great name, our hearts may burn
within us, and &ldquo;our eyes may be opened to behold wondrous
things out of His law;&rdquo; <a name="citation107"></a><a
href="#footnote107" class="citation">[107]</a> we may still be
powerfully impressed, if we have, what we are taught by our
church to pray for, &ldquo;grace to hear meekly the word, and to
receive it with pure affection, and to bring forth the fruits of
the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May I not appeal, in justification of these remarks, to some
of you here present?&nbsp; Have not your minds, when intent <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>upon the
doctrines of the gospel, and taking a view of heavenly things,
been sometimes visited with a holy illumination, which has seemed
to raise you above the world, and to make you feel more sensibly,
that &ldquo;you have your conversation in heaven?&rdquo; <a
name="citation108"></a><a href="#footnote108"
class="citation">[108]</a>&nbsp; Have not the ties of earth been
loosened, while your soul was expatiating on the deep things of
God, on His wisdom and power and love, on the dealings of His
providence and grace, on the glories of His eternal
presence?&nbsp; Have you not, in some such moments, been so
impressed, as to return to the world with a degree of reluctance;
and, like the disciples at the transfiguration, almost tempted to
say, of your spiritual and heavenly visions, &ldquo;it is good
for me to be here?&rdquo;&nbsp; These are no enthusiastic
imaginations; they are the sober and solid effects of the
realized presence of our Redeemer; they are the burnings of
heart, of which the disciples spake; they are the foretaste of
our knowledge and joy and light and <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>life above.&nbsp; Doubtless they are
to be encouraged with humility and sobriety; doubtless they may
degenerate into enthusiasm; for there is no spiritual good, which
may not be abused: but the fear of enthusiasm is not to hinder us
in gathering comfort and delight from the study of scriptural
truth, from holy and exalted meditation.&nbsp; The world may call
it weakness and folly; for it cannot be understood by the world;
but the Christian knows for it a better name; and few eminent
Christians have there been, who would not readily bear witness to
the truth of these things, who have not felt the inspiriting,
uplifting power of divine contemplation.</p>
<p>And this, like all other exercises of true faith and piety, is
of great practical importance; it is fruitful in righteousness to
all who &ldquo;think soberly;&rdquo; it serves them, when they
return to the busy scenes of earth, as an animation to duty; it
purifies their affections and renders the world little in their
eyes; it arms them for conflict, and reconciles them to trouble:
in the <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>midst of trials, of disappointments and bereavements,
of struggles and difficulties, of frowns and oppositions, they
remember, with thankfulness and comfort, the spiritual joys they
have experienced, and expect to be blessed with them again: yes,
in their darker hours, they remember, that the Sun of
righteousness, has shone brightly upon them, and the beams are
still reflected; though they cannot at present perceive Him so
clearly, though He seems, like Jesus with the disciples, to have
&ldquo;vanished out of their sight,&rdquo; He has left a glory
behind, and will again visit them with the fulness of His favour;
and they go on their way &ldquo;not faithless, but
believing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To those who have been thus in the habit of pious and
scriptural meditation; of intently dwelling upon the sublime
mysteries, and the gracious promises, and the noble examples, and
the striking histories of the word of God; to them it is needless
to recommend a continuance of the good work; it is a christian
obligation, <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>which they can never think of declining; and besides
this, the delight and improvement, which it affords, are its own
sufficient recommendation.&nbsp; But upon all, who have unhappily
neglected this their great privilege and duty, I would most
earnestly press the importance of attending to this point, as a
matter of bounden necessity.&nbsp; It is not enough to form an
acquaintance with the leading truths of the gospel, as a matter
of faith and profession; there is much to be learnt upon a nearer
inspection, much indeed that can never be learned without it;
much to enlarge and exalt the understanding; to renew the heart
and regulate the life.&nbsp; The necessary intercourse, which
most of us have with the world, is of a lowering and defiling
nature; estranging the heart from a love of holiness and of God:
and in order to correct this evil, scriptural study and spiritual
consideration, as well as fervent prayer, are indispensable.</p>
<p>Let not any day pass over your heads <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>without
some portion of the Bible, some subject of divine revelation,
being brought distinctly to your view.&nbsp; The exercise will
interfere with none of your earthly duties, but will help you in
the performance of them all; will smooth whatever there be of
ruggedness in your way; will strengthen you in the hour of
temptation, and comfort you in perplexity and trouble.&nbsp; Many
an encouraging promise and many an enlivening assurance will
recur to your memory; and &ldquo;a word in season how good is
it:&rdquo; examples of suffering and patience, of striving and
perseverance, of warfare and triumph, will kindle in your breast
an emulous ardour, and you will say, &lsquo;By the help of the
Lord, I will &ldquo;go and do likewise.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus
will the Bible be a never-failing source of strength and
consolation all the day long; as the waters, which flowed from
the flinty rock, accompanied and refreshed the Israelites, ever
and anon, in their journey through the wilderness, so will your
spiritual musings, <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>suggested by the very hardships or troubles of life, be
a perpetual stream of refreshment to your souls, even &ldquo;in a
dry land thirsty land, where no water is.&rdquo; <a
name="citation113a"></a><a href="#footnote113a"
class="citation">[113a]</a></p>
<p>And by this means you will be preparing and training your
souls for a happier communion with the Saviour in another world;
where all the dealings of His providence, and all the wonders of
His grace, will be more fully and gloriously manifested.&nbsp;
And if the heart of the Christian now burn within him, at the
contemplation of heavenly truth and redeeming love; now, in his
frail tenement of clay; how unspeakable will be his delight, when
these things are revealed to his pure spirit, in the realms of
perfection and bliss.&nbsp; Then will he know more of &ldquo;the
love of Christ which passeth knowledge;&rdquo; then will he see
more of &ldquo;the length and breadth and depth and height&rdquo;
<a name="citation113b"></a><a href="#footnote113b"
class="citation">[113b]</a> of the mystery of mercy; he will see
God &ldquo;face to face&rdquo; and &ldquo;know even as he is
known.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">IF THEY HEAR NOT MOSES AND THE
PROPHETS.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Luke</span> xvi. 31.</p>
<p><i>If they hear not Moses and the Prophets</i>, <i>neither
will they be persuaded</i>, <i>though one rose from the
dead</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us advert to the occasion on
which these words were delivered, to the parable of which they
form a part.&nbsp; The case there presented to us by the
description of the rich man is unhappily of frequent occurrence
in every age.&nbsp; Surrounded by all the luxuries that wealth
could furnish, he looked for nothing beyond them: how many fellow
mortals there were near his dwelling, deprived of the
necessities, while <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>he was revelling in the superfluities of life, was no
care, no consideration of his; the selfish enjoyment of this
world entirely absorbed his affections, and threw a veil over all
expectation of a world to come: satisfied, that he had
&ldquo;goods laid by for many years,&rdquo; he imagined that he
had nothing to do, but to &ldquo;eat, drink, and be
merry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But such ignorance and insensibility did not prevent him from
being called to account; such forgetfulness of his latter end did
not retard the evil day.&nbsp; He died&mdash;and was buried, we
may conclude, with costly preparation answerable to the splendour
in which he had lived.&nbsp; This however, was the last service
which his riches were able to render him; and melancholy it was,
when contrasted with the state, in which his soul was existing,
while his treasures were employed in doing honour to the lifeless
body.&nbsp; He found in that state, what he might have discovered
before, that riches, if selfishly employed in purposes of vanity
and pleasure, <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>are a deadly snare; that earthly indulgences, if
pursued with excess, to the neglect of duty towards God and man,
instead of being a blessing, are paving the way to misery; he
found, &ldquo;what an evil and bitter thing it is,&rdquo; to
squander the favours of heaven without remembering &ldquo;the
author and giver of every good gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perceiving therefore, by sad experience, his own deplorable
condition, he is represented as being moved with a feeling of
pity for his brethren: his first anxiety, indeed, was naturally
for himself&mdash;for some alleviation, at least, of the
wretchedness of his fate; but when he was informed that such
desire was fruitless, that even the assuagement of his pain was
impossible, that there was no means of conveying even a drop of
water to cool the thirst upon his tongue, that the great gulf was
finally and irremoveably fixed, he then hoped that something
might be done for his brethren who were still surviving; they had
not yet passed the boundary of life and grace; <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>and
therefore he entreats that, while the far-spent day was shining
upon them, Lazarus might be despatched from his abode of bliss,
to warn them of the untimely end to which they were hastening;
and induce them effectually to repent before &ldquo;the night
should come, in which no man can work.&rdquo; <a
name="citation117a"></a><a href="#footnote117a"
class="citation">[117a]</a></p>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s answer is, &ldquo;they have Moses and the
prophets, let them hear <i>them</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; A messenger
from the court of heaven could tell them nothing new; they are
already acquainted with their duty and the consequences of
neglecting it: Jehovah has revealed unto them His blessed will,
and clearly made known what is required of them, &ldquo;to do
justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with their
God.&rdquo; <a name="citation117b"></a><a href="#footnote117b"
class="citation">[117b]</a>&nbsp; His covenant with their
fathers, and the promulgation of His law, have been attested by a
series of signal miracles, which they do not pretend to dispute;
and in every page of their history are recorded God&rsquo;s
promised blessings to <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>the good, and the execution of His
vengeance upon the evil; and, therefore, in as far as knowledge
is concerned, they have all the intelligence that can be
desired.</p>
<p>But the wretched man, in the agony of his own feelings, and
the earnest desire to preserve his family from such woe, still
pursues his request.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, father Abraham;&rdquo;
but, though they have neglected the ordinary calls of heaven,
assuredly, if so astonishing an admonition were granted to them,
as that of one risen from the dead, they would be thereby
persuaded to repent.&nbsp; Then follows the answer of the text,
&ldquo;If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they
be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
thus the conference ended.</p>
<p>From this conclusion of the parables two important
observations may be drawn <i>first</i>, that if men fail to be
convinced and converted, to be led to their God and their duty,
by those sufficient means of grace which are already vouchsafed
to them, they would not be likely to yield to <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>any
extraordinary means; and, <i>secondly</i>, that no such
additional means are to be expected.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In all cases of spiritual and practical unbelief, in
all cases where the declarations of the Almighty are disregarded,
the fault lies not so much in the understanding as in the
heart.&nbsp; The revelations of heaven are at variance with those
interests and pursuits, which the heart is inclined and resolved
to retain; and on this account, and by this means, the mind is
prejudiced and set against such revelations, and they are not
fully and implicitly believed.&nbsp; They call men to the love
and practice of holiness, to which our degenerate nature is
averse; the pleasures of sin are preferred, and the voice of God
is unheeded: they teach us, that all earthly objects and
possessions, in themselves, are vain, and call us to prepare for
an everlasting inheritance above; the sensual and worldly-minded
think and feel, that &ldquo;it is good for them to be
here,&rdquo; and are not disposed to place their affections upon
<a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>the
promise of an hereafter.&nbsp; We none of us professedly
disbelieve the revelation of heaven, any more than the brethren
of the rich man did; and therefore I need not stay to argue the
point on that ground.&nbsp; The doctrine before us is this, that
men, professing to believe, to have received abundant evidence of
the truth, and yet refusing to act upon that belief, would not be
induced so to act, by any violent appeal to their senses or
natural powers, even though it were the work of a divine
interposition in their behalf.</p>
<p>What do we believe?&nbsp; That, after this life, which
experience tells us must soon terminate, and which may, at any
moment, be unexpectedly and suddenly brought to a close, we shall
immediately enter upon another and an eternal state of being; and
that our condition, in the endless life to come, will be happy or
miserable, according to the manner in which we have passed our
short pilgrimage upon earth, whether in a belief of the gospel or
in unbelief; in obedience or <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>disobedience; in holiness or
sin.&nbsp; Now, if we really and vitally believe these truths,
their importance is so striking, that nothing could possibly
suggest to the mind a weightier consideration.&nbsp; And if these
truths be only superficially credited, it must be owing to some
corrupt and perverted affections, which throw a veil over the
understanding, and render it proof against all moral means of
conviction.&nbsp; Perhaps some strange and startling occurrence,
such as the re-appearance of a friend from the dead, might
forcibly affect the imagination for a time; and, filling us with
alarm and apprehension, might fill us also with vehement
resolutions of amendment: but the imagination is a weak principle
to build upon; the impressions it receives are commonly very
transient; they gradually wear away on the presentation of fresh
images, in our commerce with the world: and if there be not a
solid spiritual conviction, in the mind and heart, of the awful
realities of an hereafter, if the conviction does not <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>rest upon
the divine evidence accorded by the Spirit and the word of God,
the effects of sudden surprise or consternation will soon vanish
away; the latent dispositions of the soul will break forth again;
the old habits, of recklessness and evil, be reassumed; the world
again victorious.</p>
<p>For the truth of these things, I appeal, if not to yourselves,
(as in many instances, I reasonably may) but if not, to those
around you.&nbsp; How many examples have occurred, within the
compass of your own experience, of extraordinary visitations
having produced but a very short-lived influence upon the heart
and character?&nbsp; How often have we seen the careless awakened
by an alarming sickness, by an approach of the king of terrors,
(which can hardly be supposed less convincing than an angel from
heaven, or a spirit from the blest), and yet awakened only to
return, on the removal of danger, to the slumbers of
insensibility and sin.&nbsp; The solemn promises, which the
terrified sinner made to his friends, his minister, <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>and his
God, were but the offspring of fear; the creatures of
imagination; born only for the moment; soon disappearing, when
the crisis was past.</p>
<p>And when the stroke of death has actually fallen upon a
relative or friend, we have sometimes seen it overwhelm the soul
of a heedless survivor, and bring him to himself, to serious
thought and repentance; he began to sit loose to the remaining
interests of life; he looked with anxiety to the world unknown,
and formed resolutions of devoting his years to a constant
provision for futurity; but all to no ultimate purpose; the
subject had sued for his attention before, and been
rejected.&nbsp; When his affections have had time to cool, he
finds that no new importance has really been given to the truth;
the evidences of it rest as they did; others have lost friends as
well as he; it is the common lot of mortality; and he cannot keep
alive the impression for ever; the world must be attended to; and
one object after another continues to gain an ascendancy, <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>till his
new-born hopes and fears are extinct; till his principles and
conduct and views return to their old level, from which they will
in future become the more difficult to be raised.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary for me to insist, that this is no ideal
picture, drawn for the mere occasion of placing the subject in a
strong light; your own acquaintance with the world may furnish
you with living resemblances of it; and it is unhappily the lot
of Christian Ministers, who have more frequent opportunity of
witnessing such impressions, to observe, in the end, their
repeated and lamentable failure; to perceive how far they fall
short of lasting conviction and salvation.</p>
<p>Well, therefore, in the affectionate and faithful discharge of
our duty, may we call upon our hearers to weigh, in the
dispassioned hours of health and tranquillity, the nature and the
moment of those divine truths, which the gospel clearly reveals
unto man; to judge rightly and truly of their everlasting import;
and to <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>embrace them, from the undeniable evidence already
presented, with all the heart and all the soul.&nbsp; We call,
however, upon our hearers, not as if the vital impression
depended upon themselves alone, upon the exercise of their own
judgment or the workings of their own conscience.&nbsp; We call
upon them to pray for, and be guided by, the mighty operation of
the Spirit of God: He is ever ready to enlighten and instruct and
quicken and determine them; giving us His grace, &ldquo;that we
may have a good will, and working with us, when we have that good
will.&rdquo; <a name="citation125"></a><a href="#footnote125"
class="citation">[125]</a>&nbsp; Listen to His teaching; obey His
godly motions; follow up the convictions which He brings to the
mind and heart.&nbsp; Light enough is perpetually given, to guide
you into all truth; live in the light; walk in the light.</p>
<p>Thus, indeed, every additional admonition, which a gracious
God may be pleased to vouchsafe unto us, will be turned to good
account; our faith will be confirmed, our affections purified,
our knowledge increased, <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>our resolutions strengthened and
settled; &ldquo;unto him that hath, shall more be given;&rdquo;
the sincere and pious believer will advance, at every call, a
step nearer to his Saviour and his God; the still small voice of
heavenly warning will be heard, even amidst the ordinary
occurrences of life; the wonderful dealings of providence and the
manifold means of grace will be turned to godly account; the
instructions and examples of the living, and the contemplation of
the saints at rest, will alike afford materials for spiritual
edification.&nbsp; But if the great call to liberty and life be
habitually neglected, to liberty from sin and shame, and life to
holiness and glory, then the mind and heart are not in a
condition to take advantage of occasional excitement; it strikes,
but it does not overcome; it rouses, but the stupor returns.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Proceed we now to the second observation which may be
drawn from the text, that when men reject the abundant evidence
of truth, and the gracious invitations of heaven already given,
when they <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>have resisted the strivings of the Spirit of God, they
are not to expect Him to deviate from the ordinary rules of His
providence and grace, for the sake of removing their wilful
blindness, and overcoming their perverseness and obstinacy.</p>
<p>It is a part of the divine economy, in the salvation of man,
that he should of his own free will, by the grace of God
preventing and assisting, &ldquo;refuse the evil and choose the
good:&rdquo; and therefore man is not to expect from the Almighty
any such interference in his favour, as might absolutely overrule
his will, and compel him to hearken and obey.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s
infinite mercy is sufficiently manifested in His offer and
promise to save those rebellious sinners, who listen to the
teaching of His Spirit, who are willing to be saved in His own
appointed way.&nbsp; To save those who quench the light afforded
them, who discover no such willingness, who unthankfully turn
away and refuse the inestimable gift presented to them, would be
in direct opposition to the whole tenour of the word <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>of
God.&nbsp; And experience concurs with Scripture to inform us,
that no such extraordinary interposition is generally
vouchsafed.&nbsp; The Jews, in our Saviour&rsquo;s time, had read
of the miracles of Moses and the prophets, professed to credit
their inspiration, and their mission from on High; they had seen
the astonishing miracles of Christ Himself; and might, if they
would, have perceived the fulfilment of their prophecies in Him;
many of them were eyewitnesses to the signs and wonders attendant
upon His crucifixion; to the earthquake, and the supernatural
darkness, and the rending of the veil of their temple; nor could
they deny His resurrection from the dead.&nbsp; Against all this
body of evidence, against all the means of conviction, they
persevered in their rejection of Him.&nbsp; And the time came,
when no further testimonial was to be granted; they were left
&ldquo;to fill up the measure of their fathers;&rdquo; they died
in their sins.</p>
<p>In addition to all these opportunities and advantages afforded
to the Jew, we <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>enjoy, at this day, the fulness of the manifestation of
the gospel; the real nature of the Messiah&rsquo;s kingdom is
clearly and completely revealed unto us; the blessings of the
gospel are set before us, in the most conspicuous and glorious
light; we have all the certainty, which mortals can have, of a
world to come; all the knowledge which our imperfect faculties
could receive, of the nature of that world; and all the means of
grace and hopes of glory.&nbsp; And if by all these mercies we
are not convinced and persuaded, we can have no right or reason
to look for any preternatural or overpowering interposition, even
from the goodness and long-suffering of God.&nbsp; Rather may we
fear that judicial infatuation, so frequently alluded to in
Scripture, of the closed eye, the dull ear, and the gross
obdurate heart.&nbsp; O let the sinner, instead of flattering
himself with the delusion, that some extraordinary thing will one
day be happening to him, which shall disengage him from earth,
and fix his thoughts on heaven and <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>eternity, O let him rather apprehend
that the time is approaching, when the measure of his iniquity
shall be filled up, and God will be no longer found.</p>
<p>I am not asserting, that such signal interferences have never
been vouchsafed; that such loud awakenings have never been
successful: I mean, that they are not in the ordinary course of
divine providence, and are not to be expected.&nbsp; I mean to
say, that where the grace of the gospel is continually resisted
in the heart and life, the careless recusant is seldom reclaimed
through the medium of any extraordinary visitation; whether of
sickness, of accident, or any terrible calamity.&nbsp; The man,
who entrusts his soul to the hope and operation of such
occurrences, is placing it in imminent jeopardy.&nbsp; Whoever
will save his soul alive, let him, without delay, &ldquo;seek the
Lord, while He may be found, and call upon Him while He is
near;&rdquo; <a name="citation130a"></a><a href="#footnote130a"
class="citation">[130a]</a> peradventure God may &ldquo;laugh at
his calamity, and mock when his fear cometh.&rdquo; <a
name="citation130b"></a><a href="#footnote130b"
class="citation">[130b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>And
in other ways also does the same evil principle work, the same
evil habit of &ldquo;resisting the grace of God:&rdquo; many
persons, who express themselves thoroughly convinced of the truth
of the christian revelation, and the absolute necessity of a
spiritual obedience and a holy walking with God, put off their
work of righteousness, from year to year, in the hope, not of any
great or appalling event, but that some new circumstances may
arise, which shall make it more convenient for them to renounce
the world, and attend, without let or hindrance, to the salvation
of their souls; they will have gained a sufficiency of earthly
comforts, or they will be tired of the world; they will be
growing old and feeble, and naturally more inclined to think of
heavenly things.&nbsp; But this is only the same temptation as
the former, presented in another shape; the &ldquo;convenient
season&rdquo; is hoped for in vain; Satan never suffers us to be
without a hindrance, real or imaginary; our attachment to the
world does not wear <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>off; we grow older without growing
more religious, without drawing nearer to God; and we never are,
it is impossible we should be, <i>naturally</i> disposed to
&ldquo;turn and seek after Him:&rdquo; thus the delusion goes on;
and we &ldquo;will not be persuaded;&rdquo; and thus, too
frequently, the &ldquo;expectation cometh utterly to an end for
evermore.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no trusting to anything, but the
<i>present</i> conviction and determination, but the instant and
unreserved &ldquo;obedience of the heart unto
righteousness;&rdquo; &ldquo;to-day, if ye will hear His voice,
harden not your hearts.&rdquo; <a name="citation132"></a><a
href="#footnote132" class="citation">[132]</a></p>
<p>In conclusion, I call upon you to think on the condition of
the rich man in torment.&nbsp; His anxiety for a special
interference in behalf of his brethren is represented as useless
to <i>them</i>, but it may be salutary to <i>us</i>: It may
assure us of the wretchedness of that place, to which he was
condemned; may incline us, by the inspiration of God&rsquo;s Holy
Spirit, to value and improve His gracious gifts, while they are
mercifully <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>bestowed; may determine us, while we have the
all-sufficient light of the gospel, to be guided thereby into the
way of peace; we may learn from this awful lesson, that if (God
forbid that it should be so) but <i>if</i> any of us should be
similarly doomed, we shall mourn for ourselves, and be anxious,
that the companions we have left may be our companions no more;
let us take heed for ourselves, and be anxious for one another in
time, while the heed and anxiety may be crowned with success; may
lead us to seek and find God&rsquo;s favour and mercy, and so
&ldquo;escape from the wrath to come.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>SERMON VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PERFECT LOVE CASTETH OUT FEAR.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1 <span
class="smcap">John</span> iv. 18.</p>
<p><i>There is no fear in love</i>, <i>but perfect love casteth
out fear</i>: <i>because fear hath torment</i>; <i>he that
feareth is not made perfect in love</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the sources of happiness,
which the merciful God has opened to us, the most pure and
abundant are the feelings of affection and love.&nbsp; I appeal,
for the truth of this, not to the understandings, but to the
hearts of those that hear me; and they will at once testify,
unless corrupted and perverted by selfish or vicious habits, that
such, even with regard to earthly happiness, is undoubtedly the
fact.&nbsp; Persons indeed of inferior principle, of <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>irregular
and irreligious lives, frequently draw from this source the most
considerable portion of their pleasure, whatever abatements it
may receive from their sin and folly: and when the passions are
attempered, and the affections purified and exalted, by the
influence of our holy religion, by the refining energy of the
spirit of God, the delight naturally and necessarily becomes
proportionably greater.&nbsp; &ldquo;To love one another&rdquo;
is not only our first earthly duty, as injoined by the Saviour,
but also our highest interest and advantage, as contributing to
the happiness of all.</p>
<p>If then so much enjoyment is derived by mankind from the
exercise of mutual love, how much more from the love of
God&mdash;the pure, the gracious, the ever blessed God;
&ldquo;who loadeth us with His benefits;&rdquo; who made us what
we are, and gave us what we have; who created us for His glory,
who redeemed us from sin and death, who sanctifieth all that
trust in Him, that they may be happy for ever: <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>in a word,
whose goodness to us knows no bounds, but those which are set by
our own perverseness and ingratitude.&nbsp; Almighty and most
merciful Father, &ldquo;whom have I in heaven but Thee? and there
is none upon earth that I desire beside Thee.&rdquo; <a
name="citation136"></a><a href="#footnote136"
class="citation">[136]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Graft in our hearts the
love of Thy name;&rdquo; we cannot love Thee as Thou hast loved
us; but give us the grace to love Thee with holy sincerity; with
that devout and reverent affection, which shall render all other
objects of desire comparatively indifferent to us, and make us
satisfied with Thy favour, whatever else we want; which shall
calm our apprehensions, when we think of an hereafter; and allay
the uneasiness which arises in our breasts, when we reflect upon
Thine infinite holiness, and our own degenerate condition.</p>
<p>Perhaps it may be imagined, that this is a state of
blessedness attainable by few, if any, upon earth: some may urge
the text against us, and say that this blessedness <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>is promised
only to perfect love, which mortals can never hope to attain; and
that it is inconsistent with those numerous passages of
Scripture, which admonish us of the necessity of fear; that in
the admirable collect of our Church for this day, <a
name="citation137"></a><a href="#footnote137"
class="citation">[137]</a> we are instructed to pray for &ldquo;a
perpetual fear and love of God&rsquo;s holy name.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How then can we possess the love which casteth out fear?&nbsp; I
will endeavour to reply to these observations; and pray God that
we may all derive, from the consideration of this subject, a more
true and lively and abiding sense of the nature and necessity of
that love towards Him, which, as His adopted children and the
inheritors of His kingdom, we are absolutely bound to
entertain.</p>
<p>Unquestionably true it is, that the fear of God is, and ever
has been, indispensable to all His faithful servants; as well
under the mild dispensation of the gospel, as under the severer
discipline of the law.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fear of the Lord is the
beginning <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>of wisdom.&rdquo; <a name="citation138a"></a><a
href="#footnote138a" class="citation">[138a]</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear Him.&rdquo; <a
name="citation138b"></a><a href="#footnote138b"
class="citation">[138b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Unto you that fear my
name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise, with healing in His
wings.&rdquo; <a name="citation138c"></a><a href="#footnote138c"
class="citation">[138c]</a>&nbsp; And accordingly the Apostle
observes, &ldquo;In every nation, he that feareth Him, and
worketh righteousness, is accepted with Him.&rdquo; <a
name="citation138d"></a><a href="#footnote138d"
class="citation">[138d]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;His mercy is on them
that fear Him, from generation to generation.&rdquo; <a
name="citation138e"></a><a href="#footnote138e"
class="citation">[138e]</a>&nbsp; But what is the nature of this
fear?&nbsp; It is not a slavish principle, not a disturbing and
distressful feeling.&nbsp; It consists in an awful sense of
God&rsquo;s glorious perfections; of His divine Majesty,
unspotted purity, infinite knowledge and power; of His presence
pervading every part of the creation, even the very mind of every
intellectual being; such a sense, as to fill us with the deepest
humility, perceiving ourselves unworthy even to stand in the
sight of Him, &ldquo;who is of purer eyes than to behold
iniquity;&rdquo; such <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>a sense, habitually impressed upon
the heart, as inclines and constrains us to &ldquo;follow the
good&rdquo; which He loves, and &ldquo;depart from the
evil&rdquo; which He abhors.</p>
<p>And this principle is plainly and entirely consistent with the
sincerest love: our love indeed is powerfully increased by the
reflection, that our heavenly Father, of whose attributes we form
conceptions so awful and sublime, should condescend to bestow
such regard upon His frail and fallen, His disobedient and
rebellious children; it may teach us to exclaim with the
liveliest emotions of gratitude, as well as with humble adoration
and astonishment, &ldquo;Lord, what is man that Thou art mindful
of him, and the son of man that Thou visitest him?&rdquo; <a
name="citation139"></a><a href="#footnote139"
class="citation">[139]</a>&nbsp; Good reason, therefore, had the
framers of our Liturgy, for directing us to implore the united
influence of a perpetual fear and love of God&rsquo;s holy
name.</p>
<p>But the fear spoken of in the text is of another kind; it
relates to uneasy and <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>distressful apprehensions respecting
our acceptance with God; to a feeling of doubt and distrust,
whether we are, in deed and in truth, partakers of the gracious
promises of the gospel; whether we are living in a state of
reconciliation with God; whether we have within us that earnest
of the Holy Spirit, which is the pledge and seal of our
redemption; whether, in a word, we are objects of God&rsquo;s
favour here, and have a well-grounded hope of his mercy
hereafter.</p>
<p>That this is the state of mind represented to us by the
beloved Apostle, is clear from his own reasoning; &ldquo;for
fear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;hath torment:&rdquo; now the fear of
God, as above described, has no torment at all; it makes us
humble, and fills as with reverential awe, but it tends to
comfort and peace.&nbsp; We could not entirely love a Being,
whose manifestation inspired us with terror and dismay; and this
is the very reason why many, when they come seriously to consider
their condition, are filled with confusion and alarm; because
they <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>do
not love God in sincerity and truth: their affections have been
set on the world; and therefore their title to salvation, upon
the terms proposed to them in the gospel, is clearly
insufficient; they have served other masters, and have reason to
tremble for their reward from the great Lord and Master in
heaven; they have employed their talents for other purposes, than
those for which they were committed, and therefore, when they
think of making up their accounts, their lord presents himself as
&ldquo;an austere man,&rdquo; exacting more than they will be
able to render: no man can heartily love God, without an entire
obedience of the heart; this they have never shewn, and therefore
have never loved Him: how then can they expect His favour; how
can they reflect upon their condition with composure and
comfort?</p>
<p>Truly is it said, that such fear hath torment; for of all the
uneasiness which the mind can suffer here, the most painful is
that, which is produced from an apprehension <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>of
&ldquo;the terrors of the Lord;&rdquo; better not to have known
the greatness of the salvation promised, than to neglect the
means of securing it; better not to have heard of an hereafter,
than to have a reasonable dread upon the spirits, what that
hereafter shall be.&nbsp; They who have greater cause for fear
than for hope, must, if they are given to meditate and look
forward, find it cast a dismal shade over every scene and
prospect of life; they may contrive to drown their serious
thoughts, in the midst of worldly pursuits and intemperate
pleasures; but this is only for the passing hour; they cannot
possibly think, that their condition is thus really
improved.&nbsp; But why take so much pains to mitigate or conceal
a misery, which it is in our power, by God&rsquo;s gracious
mercy, effectually to prevent?&nbsp; Escape from these torments
of the conscience by a sincere devotedness to the service of your
Almighty Father, in the gospel of His beloved Son; by cherishing
in the heart that &ldquo;perfect love for Him, which casteth out
fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Yet
is this possible, it may be said, for weak and imperfect
man?&nbsp; Is it not rather a state at which we should aim, than
one at which we can ever hope to arrive?&nbsp; Certainly the
imperfect creature can never attain to actual perfection in any
moral or spiritual duty; but his will and desire may be perfect,
though his service is not; and in this sense, the duty of perfect
love is equally binding upon all believers.&nbsp; It is a very
common persuasion, and dangerous as it is common, that the
standard of christian duty is raised much higher in the gospel,
than it is necessary for the generality of Christians even to
think of reaching; that some of the commands, there given, are
intended only for the chosen few, more eminent than the rest of
mankind in spiritual attainments; and thus too many professing
disciples of our Lord, imagining themselves not bound by such
extensive obligations, are content with measures of obedience,
infinitely less than those, which are positively required;
content with a state of heart and life, far <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>short of
that, which the gospel recognises and injoins.&nbsp; But this is
a mere delusion, to suit the wayward fancy and the corrupt
inclination of man: where do we read in the Bible of such
limitations and exceptions?&nbsp; Where do we find one set of
rules for eminent Christians, and another for Christians in
general?&nbsp; Are not all its precepts, and all its principles,
and all its instructions, of universal obligation?&nbsp; When the
Saviour promised His divine blessings to &ldquo;the poor in
spirit,&rdquo; to them that &ldquo;hunger and thirst after
righteousness,&rdquo; to &ldquo;the pure in heart;&rdquo; were
the conditions intended only for the disciples around Him on the
mount?&nbsp; Were they not also designed for His followers in
every age?&nbsp; And when the Lord commanded Moses to
&ldquo;speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel,
and say unto them, Be ye holy, for I the Lord your God, am
holy,&rdquo; <a name="citation144"></a><a href="#footnote144"
class="citation">[144]</a> does the precept concern only the
people of old?&nbsp; Is it not equally applicable to
Christians?&nbsp; Yea, it <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>is urged upon us all by the mouth of
an Apostle. <a name="citation145"></a><a href="#footnote145"
class="citation">[145]</a>&nbsp; The same is true of every
spiritual doctrine, every moral command recorded in the Book of
Life: there is no means of grace, no measure of obedience
ordained, which a Christian can safely neglect.</p>
<p>Whatever, therefore, be meant in the text by <i>perfect</i>
love, that love it is the bounden and necessary duty of us all to
attain and to cherish.&nbsp; And what is really meant by this
expression, may be most readily and fully understood from a
precept of the divine law, as confirmed and enforced by our
blessed Redeemer; &ldquo;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with
all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy
strength.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the love described in the text;
perfect in <i>kind</i>, as admitting of no rival principle, of no
competition with &ldquo;the world or the things that are in the
world,&rdquo; with any or all of them together; imperfect in
<i>degree</i>, on account of the infirmity of our faith, of <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>the
weakness and corruption of human nature.</p>
<p>We cannot be at a loss to understand this distinction; yet it
may be further illustrated by an example from ordinary
life.&nbsp; The most affectionate and dutiful child will fail
occasionally to please and obey its parent; but there will be a
constant desire and endeavour to please: to have excited the
parent&rsquo;s displeasure, will bring uneasiness and sorrow; and
therefore the violations of duty will be neither wilful nor
habitual.&nbsp; And this sincere affection, for a kind and good
parent, never ceases to produce delight; the child indeed,
feeling so much respect and reverence, will be afraid of
offending, afraid of the unworthiness, afraid of the dishonour;
yet the service of obedience is rendered from choice, and not
from constraint; with emotions of joy, with a grateful endearment
of soul: slavish terror there is none; it is banished by the
overpowering principle of love.</p>
<p>The case is similar, with respect to the <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>love of
God: whoever, from a sense of the relationship which he is
privileged to bear to the almighty and gracious Creator; whoever,
from a contemplation of the high and holy perfections of the
Godhead; whoever, from a perception of the divine goodness and
mercy, does truly love the great and glorious Lord of all, will
constantly delight to serve Him; sensible indeed of his manifold
weaknesses and deficiencies, and thereby brought to grieve, and
rendered the more fearful to offend; but still entertaining no
doubt, that his services, imperfect and unworthy as they are, are
accepted at the throne of grace, through the merits of his
Redeemer, and as the fruit of faith in His prevailing name.&nbsp;
For no earthly consideration would he exchange this heavenly joy
and satisfaction; and no earthly event or dispensation, however
afflicting, can drive him even to distrust, much less to
despair.&nbsp; Though nature feels her bereavements and her
troubles, his faith is strong; and it assures him, that the very
chastisements <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>of the Lord are inflicted in mercy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; says the Apostle, &ldquo;shall separate us
from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or
persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril or sword?&nbsp;
Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him
that loved us.&nbsp; For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor
life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God,
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; <a
name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148"
class="citation">[148]</a></p>
<p>In speaking, however, of the holy confidence, with which we
are inspired by the sincere love of God, far would I be, as far
as possible, from confounding it with that self-sufficient and
presumptuous tone into which some persons have been unbecomingly
betrayed, when describing their spiritual condition.&nbsp;
Humility is the foundation of the Christian&rsquo;s confidence:
he trusts, only because he is &ldquo;strong in the <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>lord, and
in the power of His might;&rdquo; he is sufficient, only because
&ldquo;all his sufficiency is of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the purer
his love, and the higher his attainments, the more humbly and
modestly does he speak of them: he talks not of certainty,
&ldquo;as if he had already attained,&rdquo; but delights himself
with &ldquo;full assurance of faith,&rdquo; <a
name="citation149a"></a><a href="#footnote149a"
class="citation">[149a]</a> with &ldquo;full assurance of
hope;&rdquo; <a name="citation149b"></a><a href="#footnote149b"
class="citation">[149b]</a> his is not an extravagant joy,
proceeding from the arrogant assertion of an elective claim, but
a holy tranquillity of soul, arising from faith in the
Redeemer&rsquo;s undeserved mercy; from unfeigned love to the
most benevolent and perfect Being; and reposing itself upon the
unchangeable promises of Jehovah.</p>
<p>We do not question, my brethren, the claims of Almighty God to
our perfect love.&nbsp; Is He not our Creator? and could He have
formed us with any other design, than to make us happy?&nbsp; If
reason could have doubted this truth, revelation makes it
clear.&nbsp; And are we not preserved, every <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>moment of
our lives, by His infinite wisdom and mercy and power?&nbsp; And
though we are forgetful of His sustaining hand, still He feeds us
with the bounties of nature; and invites us to partake of the
riches of His grace.&nbsp; What are the greatest blessings, which
a human being, which any creature could possibly desire?&nbsp; To
be delivered from evil, and to enjoy everlasting good.&nbsp; And
did not the adorable Son of God take upon him the infirmities and
sufferings of our mortal state, to redeem us from misery, and
exalt us even to glory?&nbsp; And does not the Holy Spirit
condescend to dwell in our tabernacles of flesh, that He may
cleanse us from every sinful defilement, &ldquo;purify unto
Himself a peculiar people zealous of good works,&rdquo; <a
name="citation150a"></a><a href="#footnote150a"
class="citation">[150a]</a> and make us &ldquo;meet to be
partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light?&rdquo; <a
name="citation150b"></a><a href="#footnote150b"
class="citation">[150b]</a>&nbsp; Could we, even if we had been
worthy, have desired, have imagined for ourselves, blessings so
great and favours so exalted, as those which the good and
gracious God <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>is showering down upon us?&nbsp; Shall we not then be
inclined, from every consideration, shall we not be determined,
by God&rsquo;s grace, to love this heavenly benefactor with all
our heart&mdash;from a principle of gratitude; from an admiration
of divine perfection; from the inspiring hope and prospect of our
eternal salvation?&nbsp; Yes, let us give unto Him, not that
divided affection, which is the vain offering of a degenerate and
degraded world; but the full and unreserved energies of the
soul.&nbsp; If a portion of our heart be engrossed by any other
object, we are not the true people of the Lord; we render Him not
a reasonable or acceptable service; our love is embittered with
fear; with a fear that has, and will have, torment.&nbsp; Lord,
let our affections be altogether devoted unto Thee; pour Thy
spirit of love into our hearts, for the sake of Him &ldquo;who
loved us and gave Himself for us;&rdquo; we cannot love Thee here
upon earth as we would do, but be pleased to accept what Thou <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>enablest us
to give, the tribute of a sincere heart; and let it be to us a
never-failing source of humble confidence and holy comfort; so
that we may anticipate the joyful hour, when we shall be removed,
from this imperfect state of being, to a purer and happier world;
where, with affections exalted and understandings enlarged, we
shall render Thee a more delightful and laudable service; with
angels and archangels, and all the company of heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God is love;&rdquo; and when the veil of the flesh is
laid aside, and we are admitted into His glorious presence,
&ldquo;we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He
is;&rdquo; <a name="citation152"></a><a href="#footnote152"
class="citation">[152]</a> then will our felicity be complete,
complete for ever; then, in the fullest sense of the words, we
shall be &ldquo;made perfect in love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here then,
without a question, our true happiness lies; here is our all: let
us pray that we may never lose sight of it; that the desire, now
<a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>kindled,
may never be extinguished; that every &ldquo;heart may there be
fixed, where true joys are to be found, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>SERMON IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HUMBLE YOURSELVES UNDER THE MIGHTY HAND OF
GOD.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1 <span
class="smcap">Peter</span> v. 6.</p>
<p><i>Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God</i>, <i>that
He may exalt you in due time</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is nothing, which more
peculiarly marks the character of the faithful Christian, than
the manner in which he submits himself to the appointments and
dispensations of his God.&nbsp; The worldly and carnal spirit
either frets and repines under the visitations of misfortune, or
is disconsolate and cast down; or, at the best, bears up with a
mere animal fortitude against them: it finds no comfort to flee
unto, <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>but such as is afforded by the vain world, in which it
has already met with vexation und disappointment; and if the
world is unable to secure a continuance in prosperity, still less
is it able to provide a refuge in the dismal days of sorrow.</p>
<p>So lamentably indeed has this truth been experienced by many,
that they have been driven to the fallacious and fatal expedient
of attempting at once to drown their cares in intemperance; they
have found nothing in the world sufficient to satisfy their
reason, or to soothe their irritated feelings; and therefore have
destroyed their faculties, that they might not reflect; and cut
short the thread of that life, which they imagined themselves
unequal to support: and some indeed have had recourse to a more
speedy and awful means of delivering themselves from the burden
of mortification and grief; ill prepared as they were, their own
hand of violence has hurried them into the presence of their
Judge.&nbsp; And even they, who have been preserved from these
most <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>miserable extremities, have sufficiently testified by
their conduct, that the world has nothing satisfactory to offer,
for the healing of a wounded spirit, or the removal of a load of
sorrow.</p>
<p>Religion, the religion of the gospel, is the only source from
which true comfort or support can possibly be drawn; and we see
her triumphs manifested in the most blessed and remarkable manner
when the faithful servant of God is overwhelmed with trouble; we
perceive his mind in a state of tranquillity, under a conviction,
that the Lord &ldquo;doeth all things well;&rdquo; and
remembereth mercy, no less in chastisement, than in the time of
prosperity; his unquiet emotions are subdued into holy subjection
to the divine will; his affections are set the more earnestly on
things above; the vanities of earth have lost their hold; and
there ariseth in the heart that &ldquo;peace of God, which
passeth all understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They who have been much conversant with scenes of sickness or
of sorrow, cannot <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>fail to have observed the truth of these remarks, to
have been struck with the vast difference in the behaviour of
men, in proportion as they have imbibed the true spirit and
principle of the gospel.&nbsp; Some we have seen dismayed,
disturbed, and restless; with nothing in their countenance, but
vexation or anguish; others, cheerfully bearing up under the
evils which have befallen them; and, by their expressions of
joyful resignation, delighting and comforting the friends, who
were shedding over them the tears of sympathy; the power of the
word of God, the &ldquo;joy of the Holy Ghost&rdquo; has been
visible in their very features.&nbsp; Those persons, who have
beheld such an example, have been favoured with an instructive
lesson, which they should &ldquo;grave on the tablet of their
heart;&rdquo; a lesson teaching them, faithfully and forcibly,
where to look for aid in the reverses and afflictions of
life.</p>
<p>Yet, in order to lead us more effectually to cultivate, and to
reap the benefit of, this heavenly frame of mind, let us <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>now
consider the bearing of the apostolic charge in the text,
&ldquo;Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here we may discover powerful reasons
intimated, why we should bring ourselves into a state of entire
submission to the divine will, and rest satisfied and resigned
under every dispensation.&nbsp; The hand of God is mighty: He is
the sovereign Lord of all; has an absolute right to dispose of
His creatures, according to His good pleasure; and is alone able
both to know and to do, what their several necessities
require.&nbsp; They, therefore, who profess themselves His
people, are bound, by that very profession, unreservedly to
submit to His sovereign disposal: &ldquo;Shall the clay say to
him that fashioneth it, what makest thou?&nbsp; O Lord, Thou art
our Father, we are the clay, and Thou our potter; and we all are
the work of Thy hand.&rdquo; <a name="citation158"></a><a
href="#footnote158" class="citation">[158]</a>&nbsp; He who
created, He who redeemed us, He to whom alone we can look for
sanctification and life, should and will maintain the dominion <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>over us: He
that gave us our being, must be able, and cannot be unwilling, to
&ldquo;give us all things needful both for our souls and
bodies.&rdquo;&nbsp; We understand not how He formed us from the
dust of the earth; so neither can we understand the methods of
His providence; but, as &ldquo;the life is more than meat,&rdquo;
so may we trust His goodness and His power, to preserve, in the
best and wisest manner, the being of those, who seek His
protection and submit to His government.&nbsp; A wise son yields
to an affectionate father, even in points where he cannot
comprehend the entire wisdom of his discipline and correction;
yields, not only because experience has taught him the benefit of
subjection, but also for the sake of obedience to a father, who
is entrusted with the guidance of him, and has a right to be
obeyed; much more should we, the adopted children of the Most
High, bow with meekness and reverence before an Almighty and
heavenly Father, though we altogether comprehend not the purpose
<a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>of the
trials, which He bringeth upon us: they are chastisements of
mercy, of whatever kind they be, and moreover are ordained by
Him, who has the entire undisputed right of dominion over us.</p>
<p>Another consideration here suggested is, that all resistance
is vain; &ldquo;the mighty hand of God&rdquo; is
uncontrollable.&nbsp; Utterly weak and fruitless were all the
assembled powers of the universe, combined against His wall: what
can a frail creature do, child of the dust, akin to the
worm?&nbsp; If God strikes, who shall stay or avoid the
blow?&nbsp; Whatever visitation He is pleased to send, to a
family or to an individual&mdash;of sickness, of calamity, of
death&mdash;there is no keeping it out of the dwelling; it may be
softened by resignation, it may be removed, and even blessed, by
prayer; but we cannot hinder the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s
will.&nbsp; In the language of the pious Hannah, &ldquo;The Lord
killeth and maketh alive; He bringeth down to the grave and
bringeth up&mdash;He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and
lifteth up the <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes,
and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of
the earth are the Lord&rsquo;s, and He hath set the world upon
them.&nbsp; He will keep the feet of His saints, and the wicked
shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man
prevail.&rdquo; <a name="citation161a"></a><a
href="#footnote161a" class="citation">[161a]</a></p>
<p>Yes truly; the afflicting hand of God is mighty in operation,
both to the wicked and the good; the former are constrained to
feel, though they will not heartily or practically acknowledge,
that there is no dependence to be placed on the schemes or
exertions of man; no trusting, that &ldquo;to-morrow will be as
this day and much more abundant.&rdquo; <a
name="citation161b"></a><a href="#footnote161b"
class="citation">[161b]</a>&nbsp; When &ldquo;riches shall have
made themselves wings and have flown away;&rdquo; <a
name="citation161c"></a><a href="#footnote161c"
class="citation">[161c]</a> when the favourite or the friend have
been cut off; when the bodily frame is under the influence of
alarming disease; then the sinner, if he be not spiritually
humbled, will, at least be made sensible, that there is a power
which can <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>lay him low; the conviction is forced on his mind,
though he may refuse to act upon it; his conscience is smitten,
though he will not obey its emotions; it assures him of the
vanity of human devices, of human dependencies and strength,
though it fail to incline him to his God.</p>
<p>How blessedly different the effect of the mighty hand of God
upon the sincere Christian!&nbsp; Even the heaviest affliction,
the most untoward or adverse occurrence, produces, when he comes
to reflect, a salutary influence on his mind and heart.&nbsp;
Perceiving that it is the natural tendency of a smooth
uninterrupted course, to make him rest satisfied with earthly
enjoyments, and draw aside his attention from the sublimer
delights and the more substantial interest of heavenly things, he
acknowledges, not only with acquiescence, but with gratitude, the
severer dispensations of providence; he knows, that his faith
must be tried and his patience made perfect; it is the very
object for which he is placed in this transitory state of
existence; <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>he therefore implores his gracious Father, to sanctify
to him the crosses and disappointments below, and make them
minister to the completion of his happiness above; whatever they
are, they are less than his transgressions deserve; whatever they
are, they are &ldquo;of God&rsquo;s sending,&rdquo; to lead him
to reflection and repentance; and very efficacious are they for
the fulfilment of this merciful purpose; perhaps the only means
by which he could have been preserved from falling, amidst the
snares and temptations that surround him.&nbsp; The Christian is
ready to confess, and many we have heard with thankfulness
confessing, that of all the mercies received from the hands of
God, the most distinguished, because the most effectual for his
salvation, are the vicissitudes and troubles of life: how many a
sincere believer, by the discomfiture of his earthly prospects,
has been led to fix his heart more intently and stedfastly, upon
the unchangeable felicity of heaven; how many, at the death of a
friend, have <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>sought more earnestly and experienced more abundantly,
&ldquo;the power of the spirit of consolation;&rdquo; and have
thereby been led to transfer their affections to that blessed
world, where christian friends shall meet, and never separate
again.&nbsp; How many, by the infirmities of the body, have been
admonished and persuaded to make a better provision for the
health and well-being of the soul!&nbsp; The hand of God has been
mightily laid upon them, to rescue them from the tyranny of sin
and Satan, to place them in the enjoyment of &ldquo;the perfect
law of liberty,&rdquo; manifested in the gospel; to save their
souls alive.</p>
<p>Let us not regard the various calamities that befal us, of
whatever nature they may be, as the mere result of human design
or contingency; for whether they be occasioned by our own
imprudence and neglect, or by the instrumentality of an evil
world, they are permitted and ordained by a wise and merciful
God, to draw us nearer to Himself; to teach us the utter
insufficiency of all earthly <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>interests and possessions; and to
raise our thoughts to the glory of an eternal kingdom.&nbsp; And
if we receive them in a christian spirit, they will never fail to
answer their high and holy purpose.&nbsp; Let us therefore watch
and pray, that we may duly consider every calamitous day as a
sacred opportunity, as a season of grace, as the rod of our
Almighty Father to chastise us from sin: let it call us to deep
meditation and contrition, to serious examination of heart; for
it is only by the religious and spiritual observance of such
seasons, that we can ever hope to derive from them improvement
and comfort.</p>
<p>Remark and remember the language of the text, &ldquo;Humble
<i>yourselves</i> under the mighty hand of God;&rdquo; it is not
enough that we be humbled, in a worldly sense, by the stroke of
misfortune; that is a consequence, which may of necessity ensue:
the loss of possession may drive us into needy solitude; the loss
of health destroy our energy and activity; the loss of reputation
bring us to shame; the loss of <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>friends oblige us to mourn, from the
very feelings of nature; but all this while, there may be no
humility of heart, no self-abasement, no voluntary humiliation
under &ldquo;any of the dispensations of heaven:&rdquo; the
&ldquo;hand of God hath touched us;&rdquo; but we may not,
nevertheless, be vitally touched ourselves, with a proper sense
of the trials, which He has called us to endure: we must fall low
before His footstool; we must bend our knees in humble fervent
prayer; we must implore the aid of His Holy Spirit, to open our
understandings, that we may perceive the graciousness of His
dealings with us; and to enlarge our hearts, that we may take the
full benefit of His &ldquo;loving correction;&rdquo; we must
unfeignedly and fully confess, on our own part, that unworthiness
and iniquity, which excited God&rsquo;s displeasure, and required
His afflicting visitation; and that mercy, on God&rsquo;s part,
which seeketh to reclaim us from error; to &ldquo;purge our
conscience from dead works;&rdquo; to make us more alive to the
&ldquo;things which belong <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>unto our peace;&rdquo; to lead us
from the vanities of time to the momentous realities of
eternity.</p>
<p>If we thus improve the sorrowful events that await us, we
shall find a happy deliverance from them all; and it is the only
possible means, by which we can be happily delivered: this the
text implies; &ldquo;Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of
God, <i>that He may exalt you</i>;&rdquo; that you may thus be
rendered meet to partake of His mercy; that He may visit and
comfort you in your low estate; and make it instrumental to your
spiritual exaltation.&nbsp; If you murmur or complain, or do but
naturally mourn; if you manifest only the frettings of a worldly
disposition and temper, your case thereby becomes still more
grievous and intolerable; the heart is vexed by its vain and
rebellious strivings; &ldquo;the sorrow of the world worketh
misery and death.&rdquo;&nbsp; You are thus preventing the
benediction of heaven from descending upon you; you are closing
up the avenues, through which the grace of <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>God may
find its way into the heart; you are neglecting that remedy, by
which alone the stricken soul can be healed, by which your
trouble may be converted into a blessing.&nbsp; Embrace the
proffered means; humble yourself beneath the burden, with
&ldquo;a godly sorrow,&rdquo; for the sin that has brought it;
bend yourself beneath the storm of heaven, and the Sun of
righteousness will soon shine forth, and cheer you with His
brightest beam; &ldquo;the God of consolation,&rdquo; your
Redeemer, your unchangeable friend, &ldquo;the same yesterday,
to-day, and for ever,&rdquo; will turn your darkness into light;
your &ldquo;weeping will endure but for a night, and joy will
come in the morning.&rdquo; <a name="citation168"></a><a
href="#footnote168" class="citation">[168]</a></p>
<p>Or, if it be not literally so; if deliverance come not so
speedily as you desire or expect, it will assuredly come in
God&rsquo;s &ldquo;due time;&rdquo; He may wait, to try the
strength of your patience and your faith; may seem for a season,
as though He heareth not your prayer; but rest assured, <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>He does
hear, and the answer is preparing: the wise and benevolent author
of four blessings knows best when to bestow them; depend upon His
mercy, and trust Him for the time: the delay will be nothing, as
compared with the comfort when it arrives: the very delay will
minister to the fulness of your joy: you will perceive the truth
of the divine character, as drawn by the pencil of the prophet;
you may apply the prophetic description to yourself; &ldquo;For a
small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I
gather thee.&nbsp; In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for
a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on
thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer.&rdquo; <a
name="citation169"></a><a href="#footnote169"
class="citation">[169]</a></p>
<p>God will exalt every humble and faithful servant, in due time,
even in this world; not perhaps to earthly greatness and honour;
but, what is infinitely more important, to the height of His own
blessed favour; to the delight of a peaceful reconciliation with
Himself; to <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>the happiness of an approving conscience; to a
&ldquo;hope full of immortality:&rdquo; and, after death, He will
crown that hope with a glorious consummation; will exalt that
servant to the skies; far beyond the reach of change, of trouble,
or of fear.&nbsp; The Christian, like the Captain of his
Salvation, &ldquo;will be made perfect through sufferings;&rdquo;
like Him, when the combat is over, will receive the crown of
glory, and sit down for ever at the right hand of his Father and
his God.</p>
<p>He will then more fully see and admire the gracious dealings
of his merciful God and Saviour; will see, what reason he had to
be thankful for the chastisements of heaven; how they have
trained and prepared his soul for the happiness of the blest; how
wonderfully they have ministered to the fulness of his joy.&nbsp;
Bear then patiently; bear, I ought to say, thankfully, what the
Lord layeth upon thee; it is His hand that &ldquo;worketh all in

always trace His designs and operations; <a

couldst, where would be the exercise of thy faith?&nbsp; But if
thou wilt believe and trust Him, if thou wilt bow and submit, He
will thus exalt thee in due time, when thou art ready, when thy
trial is completed, when thy appointed work is done.&nbsp; This
is the seed-time; sow, and thou shalt see it spring up; labour,
and wait for the harvest; &ldquo;they that sow in tears shall
reap in joy.&rdquo; <a name="citation171"></a><a

<span class="GutSmall">THOU ART THE MAN.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">2 <span
class="smcap">Sam</span>. xii. 7.</p>
<p><i>And Nathan said to David</i>, <i>Thou art the man</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> parable, of which these words
are a part, is admired, even for its elegance and simplicity, by
every one who is capable of appreciating its merit.&nbsp; It
serves also to illustrate, in the clearest manner, the advantage
of this mode of instruction; which is intended, in the first
place, by a lively representation of the productions of nature,
or the incidents of common life, to convey an adequate notion of
a truth or doctrine in easy and familiar terms; and to leave a
more striking impression of it upon the memory and the
heart.&nbsp; The parable has a further advantage: the instruction
<a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>it
affords is not at once unfolded to the mind; the attention and
the feelings are first awakened, by the relation of some
interesting occurrence, apparently unconnected with the object in
view; by which means, an assent is gained over to the side of
truth, before the understanding has had time to be prejudiced, by
the workings of self-love, or the disinclination to religious
admonition.</p>
<p>Such was precisely the case with the parable before us.&nbsp;
Had Nathan addressed to David a direct and formal expostulation,
it is probable that the king would have considered his
interference as intrusive and impertinent; would have either
driven him from his presence, or have been prepared, by some
plausible excuse, to cast a veil over the hideousness of his
crimes.&nbsp; But the royal offender, though he could readily
palliate his own atrocity, could not bear to hear of cruelty in
another.&nbsp; When it was reported to him, that there were two
men in a city, the one rich and the other poor; that the rich <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>man, when
there came a traveller unto him, spared to take of the abundance
of his own flock, and of his own herd, and took from the poor man
a little ewe lamb, which was all he had in the world; took it
from him under the most affecting circumstances; &ldquo;for he
had bought and nourished it up, and it grew up together with him
and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of
his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a
daughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the king heard all this, his feelings
were violently excited, &ldquo;his anger was greatly kindled
against the man; and he said to Nathan, as the Lord liveth, the
man that hath done this thing shall surely die.&rdquo; <a
name="citation174"></a><a href="#footnote174"
class="citation">[174]</a>&nbsp; This was the moment for making
the application: and judge of David&rsquo;s shame and confusion
of face, on finding that all his pity, and all his anger, and all
his condemnation, had in truth been directed against himself:
&ldquo;Thou art the man.&rdquo;&nbsp; He could not help
perceiving, that great <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>as was the cruelty, which he had
been reprobating in the case laid before him, he had been guilty
of still greater himself: though he had the whole kingdom for the
exercise of his legitimate choice, he would rather deprive an
humble servant of the only object of his conjugal affection,
deprive him, by becoming, in the first instance, accessary to his
murder.</p>
<p>We may here observe, how terrible is the infatuation of
sin.&nbsp; It might have been thought that David, if he had not
immediately perceived the full intention of the prophet in laying
this parable before him, would at least, from an instantaneous
recollection of his own notorious guilt, have treated, with some
degree of lenity or forbearance, the barbarity of which Nathan
appeared to be complaining; that he would not so soon have
denounced against a delinquent, so much less heinous than
himself, the utmost severity of punishment.&nbsp; But, as if his
own conscience were clear, he immediately exclaimed against the
imagined offender, as a wretch <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>unfit to live; he does not appear to
have been awakened to a sense of his own crimes, till he heard
the overwhelming application, &ldquo;Thou art the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is generally the fascination of sin; it darkens the
understanding, and deadens the conscience, and renders men
insensible to their real condition.&nbsp; It is the great object
of the enemy of our souls, an object in which he too often
fatally succeeds, to make us blind, not only to the heinousness
and danger, but also to the very existence of guilt: so that,
however acute we may be in perceiving the transgressions of
others, and however severe in reprobating and condemning them, we
are, in very frequent instances, utterly regardless of our
own.&nbsp; Many, it is to be feared, there are, who persist in a
course of sin day after day, and year after year, without once
feeling any lively or serious compunction; while they have
frequently, in that time, been reproachfully animadverting upon
the mote which they have detected in their brother&rsquo;s
eye.</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>Perhaps of all the temporal consequences of sin, the
operation of this evil habit is one of the most calamitous; for
it not only prevents us from a repentance of the past, but serves
as an encouragement to our reckless perseverance in sin; it
destroys the very principle of vital religion; removing entirely
from our hearts the love and fear of God; and filling us with
&ldquo;envy, hatred, and malice and all
uncharitableness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let David&rsquo;s infatuation be a
warning to us, let it induce us to take diligent heed, lest we be
irreclaimably &ldquo;hardened by the deceitfulness of sin;&rdquo;
lest the conscience be at length so entirely seared, as to become
callous to the very perception of iniquity; as to make us
&ldquo;call evil good, and good evil; to put darkness for light,
and light for darkness; to put bitter for sweet, and sweet for
bitter.&rdquo; <a name="citation177"></a><a href="#footnote177"
class="citation">[177]</a></p>
<p>Before, however, we further proceed to the practical
inferences which may be drawn from this subject, it may be proper
<a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>to
notice some irreverent and reproachful remarks, which have been
made on the flagrant crimes of a person so distinguished as
David.&nbsp; Is it possible, some have urged, that such guilt,
and such hardihood in guilt, could have been found in the
&ldquo;man after God&rsquo;s own heart?&rdquo; <a
name="citation178"></a><a href="#footnote178"
class="citation">[178]</a>&nbsp; But this honourable appellation,
be it observed, was given to David, not on account of his moral
or spiritual purity, but on account of the excellence of his
character as a king; he was so named in opposition to Saul, who
had acted in wilful disobedience to the divine commands, and
therefore, in the administration of his government, was not a man
after God&rsquo;s own heart; that is, he did not (as David did,
in this particular,) perform God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>Again, it has been said, could an inspired person possibly
fall into such a complication of evil?&nbsp; Miraculous
inspiration, we answer, was not given to the sacred pen-men, as a
certain preservative from the corruption of sin, but to enable
them to <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>reveal the will of God; to guard them, in this respect,
from error; and to &ldquo;guide them into all truth:&rdquo; their
carnal appetites and passions were not supernaturally overruled;
they still had their choice between good and evil; though
revealing to mankind the holy law of God, they might themselves
neglect the duties which it injoined: many instances are recorded
of the abuse of spiritual gifts, many examples of their
consisting with unholiness and transgression.&nbsp; The very
chief of the apostles intimates to us the personal care and
watchfulness and labour which were necessary, &ldquo;lest, having
preached to others, he himself should be a castaway.&rdquo; <a
name="citation179"></a><a href="#footnote179"
class="citation">[179]</a></p>
<p>Not but that David&rsquo;s guilt was most deplorably
inconsistent with his high character and office, and was a
dishonour to religion itself; I am only shewing, that it was not
incompatible with the appellation which he had received, and the
high and holy functions which he was called to discharge.&nbsp;
And be it remembered, to <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>David&rsquo;s honour, that though
his sin was aggravated, his confession of it was full and
unreserved; that he most humbly and religiously submitted to the
penal retribution of his offended God; that his repentance was
bitter and sincere: it was &ldquo;a repentance indeed never
afterwards repented of:&rdquo; continually was his harp attuned
to the bewailing of his own depravity; continually was he
descending from the lofty strains of thanksgiving and joy, and
pouring forth in the abasement of his soul, the doleful notes of
mourning and lamentation.</p>
<p>And, in truth, there was abundant cause; for the crimes of
David afford one of the most melancholy instances of the
violation of conscience, of a departure from the service of the
Most High.&nbsp; Let it fill us with humility and fear.&nbsp; If
so eminent a servant of God could fall into such abominations,
how deeply concerned, how &ldquo;instant in prayer,&rdquo; how
vigilant and careful should we be, lest our feet be betrayed into
evil!&nbsp; We see to what <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>criminal and dangerous excess human
nature may be led, if we fail to cherish the grace of God; and
are abandoned to the government of our own corrupt desires, and
the tyranny of our spiritual adversary.&nbsp; To the lukewarm and
the wavering I need scarcely say, that without greater
seriousness and circumspection, they will assuredly be
overthrown: but let me also admonish the faithful Christian; him,
who appears to be safely pursuing the even tenour of his way; who
may be led, by the regular and habitual discharge of religious
duties, into a state of presumptuous confidence and slumbering
security; him I would admonish, from the instance of David,
&ldquo;that the heart is deceitful above all things, and
desperately wicked;&rdquo; <a name="citation181a"></a><a
href="#footnote181a" class="citation">[181a]</a> that it may,
when most implicitly trusted, most dangerously betray; let David
teach &ldquo;him that thinketh he standeth to take heed lest he
fall.&rdquo; <a name="citation181b"></a><a href="#footnote181b"
class="citation">[181b]</a></p>
<p>Some perverse and worldly-minded <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>persons have made a very different
use of the lamentable case before us; it has encouraged them in
wilful transgression; it has served them as a &ldquo;cloak for
their sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely, say they, if David could so
flagrantly transgress, how can we be expected to preserve our
integrity?&nbsp; If he was accepted of God, indulgence would
readily be extended to the comparatively trifling offences of
inferior servants.&nbsp; True; we cannot be perfect; we may hope
for pardon; but we are not, on that account, to sin
presumptuously; not to offend, because God is merciful: this did
not David.&nbsp; Whoever deliberately sins from the hope of
God&rsquo;s mercy, is taking the surest was to deprive himself of
that mercy.&nbsp; There is frequently great error in the notion
of trifling offences: no offence is trifling in the sight of an
infinitely holy God: much less any wilful offence.&nbsp; The
magnitude of a fault chiefly depends upon the circumstances under
which it is committed; much more readily could we urge an excuse
for him, who is heedlessly or suddenly <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>borne away
by impetuous passion and carnal desire, than for him, who
presumes deliberately to trample upon the law of God, because
another has been forgiven.&nbsp; Shall we thus abuse the mercies
of redeeming love?&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall we continue in sin that
grace may abound?&nbsp; God forbid.&nbsp; How shall we that are
dead to sin, live any longer therein?&rdquo; <a
name="citation183"></a><a href="#footnote183"
class="citation">[183]</a>&nbsp; Would we find the favour that
David did, we must seek it, like him, in the true spirit of
penitence and devotion; we must &ldquo;confess our wickedness,
and be sorry for our sin:&rdquo; we must hate the works and
workers of iniquity: we must imitate David, not in his crimes,
but in his repentance and reformation.</p>
<p>Let us learn another lesson from the history before us; let it
teach us the importance of being always disposed and ready to
receive spiritual counsel; of being in the habit of applying to
ourselves every opportunity of improvement, with which we may be
blessed.&nbsp; Too many, like <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>David, are extremely backward to
receive an intimation of their own errors, and to avail
themselves of the benefit of reproof.&nbsp; They are sufficiently
quick-sighted in discovering the applicability of reproach, to
their neighbour; without even suspecting that it may suit their
own case and condition.&nbsp; How many have acknowledged the
propriety and force of admonitions and rebuke, which they have
heard in the house of God, without ever taking them home to their
own breasts; and this undoubtedly is one cause, why the voice of
public instruction produces, in general, so little effect upon
the characters and conduct of men.&nbsp; While they are pleased
to imagine, that the representations and censures of the preacher
are suited to others rather than to themselves, no wonder that
they retain their neglectful, sinful, unprincipled habits, in
defiance of every remonstrance, and every warning.&nbsp; Instead
of torturing their ingenuity, to discover to what particular
persons in the congregation a discourse may <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>be most
fitly and beneficially applied, let them rather be anxious to
inquire, how far it may be accommodated to their own case; and to
all those, who presume to make a further inquiry, who are looking
around for the delinquencies of their neighbour, we would say,
restrain thy wandering eye, and look within, &ldquo;Thou art the
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A readiness to take advantage of religious instruction, is one
of the surest evidences of a christian spirit, and one of the
greatest blessings that a Christian can enjoy.&nbsp; It manifests
a christian spirit, inasmuch as it shews an humble sense of our
own failings and imperfections, and an anxious desire to recover
from them all; to &ldquo;grow in grace and in the knowledge of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.&rdquo; <a
name="citation185"></a><a href="#footnote185"
class="citation">[185]</a>&nbsp; It is one of the greatest
blessings to the Christian, because there is seldom a day, seldom
an hour that passes, from which he may not derive some spiritual
benefit.&nbsp; While the reckless <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>and self-conceited, who dwell with
complacency upon their state and character, perceive not any
counsel adapted to their wants, the humble-minded are gathering
edification from every thing around them; from all they hear and
all they see: doubtless, it must be so; for how can they, who
think themselves whole, discover the need of a physician, how can
they apply a remedy?</p>
<p>Suffer me to entreat you, in conclusion, that whenever you are
seriously impressed with a conviction of evil, or the neglect of
any christian duty, you will carry home the impression, to have
its full effect upon the heart.&nbsp; For want of this care and
this habit, many a salutary lesson, that strikes for the moment,
is afterwards thrown away, unheeded and forgotten: and thus the
very means of grace, which are ordained to recover us from sin,
and enable us to &ldquo;work out our salvation,&rdquo; become the
instruments of confirming us in error and guilt.&nbsp; The mind,
which is continually accustomed to receive and to <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>neglect
religious instruction, may be thereby brought into a heedless and
torpid state, from which it is well nigh impossible to be
roused.&nbsp; Not that any thing &ldquo;is impossible with
God:&rdquo; but I appeal to experience, and ask, whether it is
not a notorious matter of fact, that many amongst us have for
years uniformly persevered, in the same neglect of christian
duties, the same worldly principles, the same evil courses, the
same habits of intemperance and licentiousness and profaneness;
and it will not be denied, that they have, in these years,
frequently heard the voice of expostulation, and perceived the
justice, the force, and the importance of it.&nbsp; Then why are
they still unreclaimed?&mdash;because they have never followed up
the conviction of &ldquo;Thou art the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God grant, that this admonition may have its full effect upon
us; that we may go and meditate, and pray; pray daily for the
blessing of an humble and a teachable heart; pray for God&rsquo;s
grace, to correct all our sinful follies, and supply all <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>our
deficiencies.&nbsp; Probably, my brethren, we have been
&ldquo;leaning too little upon the hope of this heavenly
grace;&rdquo; we have been relying upon our own perception of
right and wrong, our own choice and decision, our own feeble
resolutions; if so, no wonder that we have failed, in our work of
repentance and spiritual change.&nbsp; &ldquo;Turn Thou us unto
Thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned:&rdquo; <a
name="citation188"></a><a href="#footnote188"
class="citation">[188]</a> here lies our hope and our strength,
in the renewing influence of the Spirit of God.&nbsp; As we do
desire, so let us fervently pray, that we may, in our course of
penitence, imitate the example of the royal psalmist, and let
contrition &ldquo;have its perfect work;&rdquo; that we may, here
below, with heart and soul, join in the pious and repentant
strains of David&rsquo;s harp, and thus may be admitted to sing
to other harps hereafter, in the chorus of the Redeemed
above.</p>
<h2><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>SERMON XI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE WAY OF THE LORD EQUAL.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Ezek</span>. xviii. 25.</p>
<p><i>Ye say</i>, <i>the way of the Lord is not equal</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Hear now</i>, <i>O house of Israel</i>; <i>is not my way
equal</i>? <i>are not your ways unequal</i>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> main purport of this chapter
was, to obviate some objections which had been groundlessly
entertained against the dealings of God with His people.&nbsp;
They were at that time suffering in a state of captivity; and the
calamities attendant upon it had been threatened long before, as
a punishment for the sins of their ancestors.&nbsp; The Jews,
therefore, assuming that this was the only cause of divine
vengeance; imagining, in the blindness <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>and pride
of their hearts, that there were no delinquencies of their own to
deserve such retribution, presumed to charge the Almighty with
injustice, for this visitation of His wrath.</p>
<p>The prophet, in the opening of the chapter, thus remonstrates
with them: &ldquo;What mean ye, that ye use this proverb
concerning the land of Israel?&rdquo; (concerning the evils with
which it is afflicted,) that ye say, in the language of
accusation and reproach, &ldquo;the fathers have eaten sour
grapes and the children&rsquo;s teeth are set on
edge?&rdquo;&mdash;thereby meaning, that the present generation
are unjustly punished for the transgressions of their
forefathers.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I live, saith the Lord, ye shall not
have occasion to use this proverb any more in
Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; I will make so visible a discrimination
between the righteous and the wicked, between those who tread in
the steps of their wicked progenitors, and those who take warning
by their examples, that you shall not have any further occasion
to use this proverb amongst you.</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>The
Jews, in this as in many other instances, misunderstood and
perverted the dispensations of the Most High.&nbsp; God had
declared, that He would &ldquo;visit the sins of the fathers upon
the children,&rdquo; and that He &ldquo;would shew mercy unto
thousands of those that loved Him;&rdquo; from which they
inferred, that worldly calamities, in the one case, and
prosperity in the other, constituted the sole recompence, which
they were severally to expect: they supposed, that when a nation
was punished, on account of the general depravity, no respect was
had to the different merits of individuals, of which that nation
consisted; and that, when a people were prospered and exalted, as
the reward of righteousness, they were all, of necessity, the
objects of divine favour.&nbsp; Whereas, these temporal rewards
and punishments formed but a part of the dispensation, under
which they were placed.&nbsp; God had far other means in store,
to bless the faithful and to afflict the transgressor.&nbsp;
Under every visitation, His unerring eye could <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>discern
between the evil and the good; the one, however prosperous in a
worldly point of view, He could mortify and humble; and the
other, in whatever evil they might be involved, He could favour
and bless.</p>
<p>But there was still another consideration, to which the Jews,
though they practically disregarded it, were specially directed;
a consideration, which might have taught them, how the seeming
irregularities, of which they complained, would be completely
rectified; it was that of a final judgment, of a world to
come.&nbsp; Their prophet Isaiah expressly says of the
transgressors, that &ldquo;their worm shall not die, neither
shall their fire be quenched.&rdquo; <a
name="citation192a"></a><a href="#footnote192a"
class="citation">[192a]</a>&nbsp; And Daniel more particularly
intimates the awful difference between the conditions of the
righteous and the wicked in a future state; &ldquo;many of them
that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake: some to
everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting
contempt.&rdquo; <a name="citation192b"></a><a
href="#footnote192b" class="citation">[192b]</a>&nbsp; But <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>the
Israelites &ldquo;had eyes and saw not, ears and heard
not;&rdquo; <a name="citation193a"></a><a href="#footnote193a"
class="citation">[193a]</a> they listened only the temporal
promises of God, and excluded from their minds the prospect of a
final retribution, of a kingdom to come.&nbsp; The prophet
awakens them to this consideration in the 4th verse,
&ldquo;Behold, saith the Lord, all souls are Mine:&rdquo; as they
are all equally My creatures, so My dealings with them shall be
without prejudice or partiality; &ldquo;The soul that sinneth, it
shall die:&rdquo; this denunciation could not possibly be
understood of temporal death; for that, they knew, must pass
equally upon all: it must relate to a final execution of
judgment, to future misery and destruction.&nbsp; The Jews were
familiar with this form of speech and this application of it: of
wisdom it is said, &ldquo;They that hate me, love
<i>death</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation193b"></a><a
href="#footnote193b" class="citation">[193b]</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end
thereof are the ways of <i>death</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation193c"></a><a href="#footnote193c"
class="citation">[193c]</a>&nbsp; A similar mode of speech, we
may observe, <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>frequently occurs in the New Testament also; in which
we continually find expressions and figures borrowed from the
Old: &ldquo;If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye,
through the spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
live.&rdquo; <a name="citation194a"></a><a href="#footnote194a"
class="citation">[194a]</a>&nbsp; And, in the book of Revelation,
mention is made of the <i>second death</i>; <a
name="citation194b"></a><a href="#footnote194b"
class="citation">[194b]</a> a term which was in use among the
Jews themselves, though not found in their inspired
writings.&nbsp; And in the same sense, we shall perceive, the
figure is repeatedly employed in the chapter before us.</p>
<p>The prophet therefore vindicates the justice and equity of God
on two substantial grounds: he directs his murmuring and
rebellious people to consider, that they were visited with
calamity for their own transgressions, as well as for those of
their forefathers; and he refers them to the future and final
judgment of the Almighty, in which the prosperity of the <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>wicked and
the sufferings of the righteous alike terminate; in which both
shall receive their just and everlasting recompence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither
shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness
of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the
wicked shall be upon him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I any pleasure
at all that the wicked should die, saith the Lord God, and not
that he should return from his ways and live?&rdquo; <a
name="citation195"></a><a href="#footnote195"
class="citation">[195]</a></p>
<p>The passages last mentioned may introduce to our notice two
considerations, most distinctly and forcibly stated in the latter
part of this chapter, in both of which we are very deeply and
peculiarly interested; they are these; that if the wicked repent
of their evil ways and turn heartily to God, they shall be
forgiven and received into His favour; but that if the righteous
fall away, they shall be condemned and perish: on the one hand,
there is ample encouragement to the sinner to return; <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>on the
other, an awful admonition, to the righteous, of the necessity of
perseverance unto the end.&nbsp; How gracious the instruction in
either point of view!&nbsp; If it were not for the heavenly
assurance of the offer of pardon to all, without partiality or
exception, many a flagrant transgressor, when brought to a sense
of his sin and shame&mdash;his conscience pierced with the
remembrance of so manifold offences against a just and holy God,
his soul over-burdened with the load of guilt&mdash;might sit
down disconsolate and despairing in the shadow of death: and if
it were not for a warning voice, bidding them, as they hope for
salvation, to persevere, the righteous, when assailed by
temptation, might at length be induced to yield, under a
presumption, that their former obedience, that the good deeds
they had already performed, would turn the balance in their
favour, and procure for them acceptance at the tribunal of God,
though they were ultimately found in the way of evil.&nbsp; Into
this error the Jews had actually fallen; <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>and do, as
it is affirmed, continue unto this day; and others might
&ldquo;follow their pernicious ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each of the important doctrines, which we are now considering,
is declared by the prophet in the most explicit and unequivocal
terms.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the wicked will turn from all his sins
that he hath committed, and keep all My statutes, and do that
which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not
die.&nbsp; All his transgressions that he hath committed, they
shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he
hath done, he shall live.&rdquo; <a name="citation197"></a><a
href="#footnote197" class="citation">[197]</a>&nbsp; None of his
former transgressions shall exclude him from the privileges and
blessings of God&rsquo;s people; he shall be freely and fully
received, without reproach, into a gracious covenant with his
God.&nbsp; This condition of acceptance manifestly implies a
vital belief in the sovereignty and mercy of God; for without
this, none would be encouraged to turn unto Him with the hope of
forgiveness and favour: &ldquo;He <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>that cometh to God must believe that
He is, and that He is the rewarder of them that diligently seek
Him.&rdquo; <a name="citation198a"></a><a href="#footnote198a"
class="citation">[198a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The just shall live by
his faith;&rdquo; <a name="citation198b"></a><a
href="#footnote198b" class="citation">[198b]</a> and the duties
which the prophet prescribed to his people, as the means of
saving their souls alive, were evidently regarded by him as the
fruit of that faith.&nbsp; Thus, therefore, they were left
without excuse; no longer able to say, &ldquo;that the way of the
Lord was not equal;&rdquo; for so far from having decreed to
involve them all in the same indiscriminate punishment, He was
willing, nay desirous, of admitting into His favour even the most
disobedient and abandoned amongst them.&nbsp; Although in a state
of miserable bondage, He would either &ldquo;break their bonds
asunder,&rdquo; and provide them with a place of refuge; or He
would make their bodily afflictions minister to the well-being of
their souls.&nbsp; If the light of His countenance shone upon
them, happy was their lot in the <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>darkest hour of suffering and
privation: and if they did not live to enjoy a restoration to the
privileges of their own land, still might they rejoice, in the
prospect of being restored to their forfeited inheritance in the
mansions of eternal peace.&nbsp; Would they but forsake the
idols, after which they were gone astray, and turn to &ldquo;love
the Lord their God with all their heart and soul and
strength,&rdquo; &ldquo;ceasing to do evil, and learning to do
well,&rdquo; though &ldquo;their sins were as scarlet, they
should be as white as snow; though they were red like crimson,
they should be as wool.&rdquo; <a name="citation199"></a><a
href="#footnote199" class="citation">[199]</a>&nbsp; Surely none
but the obstinate and rebellious, none but the hardest and most
ungrateful heart, could complain of the dealings of God.&nbsp;
Wonderful indeed was the patience which had borne with them so
long; adorable the mercy which was still held out for the
encouragement and return of a backsliding people.</p>
<p>Under the gospel dispensation, the same gracious doctrine is
yet more fully revealed.&nbsp; <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>&ldquo;If any man sin, we have an
Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.&rdquo; <a
name="citation200a"></a><a href="#footnote200a"
class="citation">[200a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;If we confess our sins,
He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us
from <i>all</i> unrighteousness.&rdquo; <a
name="citation200b"></a><a href="#footnote200b"
class="citation">[200b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord is
long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish,
but that <i>all</i> should come to repentance.&rdquo; <a
name="citation200c"></a><a href="#footnote200c"
class="citation">[200c]</a>&nbsp; Texts indeed there are without
number of the same merciful import; and numerous also are the
examples, recorded in Holy writ, in which the Saviour vouchsafed
His loving kindness and favour to the weary and heavy-laden
sinner; &ldquo;seeking and saving those that were lost;&rdquo;
and thus affording us the most ample assurance of the truth of
His own gracious promise, &ldquo;Him that cometh to me I will in
no wise cast out.&rdquo; <a name="citation200d"></a><a
href="#footnote200d" class="citation">[200d]</a>&nbsp; Are there
any amongst us, my brethren, who have not yet made their peace
with God; any, whom Satan hath hitherto held fast in &ldquo;the
gall of bitterness, and the bond of iniquity;&rdquo; who <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>feel the
wretchedness of their condition here, and are alarmed at the
expectation of what may come hereafter?&nbsp; May &ldquo;the
goodness of God lead them to repentance!&rdquo;&nbsp; However
deep and dangerous the wounds which sin has made in their hearts,
there is &ldquo;balm in Gilead,&rdquo; if they will earnestly
seek it, and apply it to their souls: their offended Lord is
still &ldquo;waiting to be gracious;&rdquo; and though they have
been prodigally wasting his bounty in riotous living, yet if they
be at length pierced to the heart by the misery to which it has
brought them, and be truly desirous of returning to their
peaceful home, and be ready, with all humility and contrition, to
acknowledge their unworthiness, and to seek again the divine
favour, from which they have been so unhappily estranged, then
they will be received even with welcome; if but one sinner
return, there &ldquo;will be joy in heaven;&rdquo; and the family
of the blest will hail his reception; and his wanderings shall be
mentioned no more.&nbsp; &ldquo;Awake thou <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>that
sleepest and rise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
light.&rdquo; <a name="citation202"></a><a href="#footnote202"
class="citation">[202]</a></p>
<p>But let not this gracious offer of mercy be abused; let it not
act as an encouragement to a continuance in sin, under a notion
that transgressions, however multiplied and aggravated, may be,
at any future day, repented and forgiven.&nbsp; The grace of
repentance, like every other good gift, cometh from God; and the
proffered mercy, which is long and obstinately rejected, may be,
and often is, withdrawn.&nbsp; If we will not hear, while the
Almighty now speaks; if we will not answer, while He is now
calling, &ldquo;the ear may become heavy that it cannot
hear,&rdquo; and we may be left to perish in our sins.&nbsp; One
word more; think of the many sudden departures; you are not
without awakening and awful examples; your eye may be closed in
death, while it is turned away from your God; or if you should be
permitted to experience a few days&rsquo; alarm, God alone knows
what effect it may produce <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>upon the heart.&nbsp; Seek Him
&ldquo;in health and wealth;&rdquo; the work is of amazing
magnitude and everlasting importance; it demands all your vigour,
all the unclouded faculties of your soul.</p>
<p>And let those who have embraced the blessed gospel, in
sincerity and truth, who are believing in the name of Jesus for
salvation, and &ldquo;are fruitful in every good word and
work,&rdquo; ever bear in mind the absolute necessity of
persevering in the good and holy cause.&nbsp; For of what service
can it be, to begin the race with animation, and to pursue it,
for a season, with ever so great activity, if they loiter before
the end, and relinquish their exertions &ldquo;for the prize of
their high calling?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When the righteous
turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity, and
doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man
doeth, shall he live?&nbsp; All his righteousness that he hath
done shall not be mentioned; in his trespass that he hath
trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>in them
shall he die.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here also we must allow, that
&ldquo;the way of God is equal.&rdquo; <a
name="citation204"></a><a href="#footnote204"
class="citation">[204]</a>&nbsp; For surely it argues the most
depraved and abandoned state of mind and heart, to depart from
our God and our Redeemer, after having been once convinced of the
truth and the blessedness of His holy religion; having
&ldquo;tasted how gracious the Lord is,&rdquo; having experienced
the guidance and comfort and support of his all-powerful spirit,
having had our &ldquo;hopes full of immortality,&rdquo; having
enjoyed a foretaste of the happiness of heaven, after all to fall
away, and prefer to these exalted objects, the miserable
pleasures, the base indulgencies, the perishable possessions of
earth!&nbsp; A change so disastrous must reduce the understanding
and heart into the worst condition of which they are
capable.&nbsp; It is the evil spirit, which had been once cast
out, returning to his abode, with seven other spirits more wicked
than himself, and dwelling there, as in a settled home, and <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>the last
state of that man is worse than the first. <a
name="citation205a"></a><a href="#footnote205a"
class="citation">[205a]</a>&nbsp; The Apostle represents the
matter to us in this light: for so difficult is it for a person,
in such a state, to be worked upon by any consideration, that he
describes it, in his strong language, as an actual impossibility:
&ldquo;it is impossible, (he says) for those who were once
enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made
partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of
God, and the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall
away, to renew them again unto repentance;&rdquo; <a
name="citation205b"></a><a href="#footnote205b"
class="citation">[205b]</a> and then he adds the reason,
&ldquo;seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh,
and put Him to an open shame;&rdquo; they maintain the horrid
principles and character of those who &ldquo;crucified the Lord
of glory;&rdquo; they deliberately renounce his friendship, and
become &ldquo;enemies to the cross of Christ;&rdquo; they cast a
shameful reproach upon Him, infinitely greater than it is
possible for those enemies to do, <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>who were never admitted into the
privilege and happiness of His favour.&nbsp; Fain would we hope,
that this is a case of rare occurrence; but it is possible, or
why should the prophet and Apostle have represented it?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Therefore, let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed
lest he fall;&rdquo; <a name="citation206a"></a><a
href="#footnote206a" class="citation">[206a]</a> &ldquo;let him
give all diligence to make his calling and election sure.&rdquo;
<a name="citation206b"></a><a href="#footnote206b"
class="citation">[206b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The just shall live by
his faith: but if <i>that man</i>, (however faithful and just he
has been) draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in
him;&rdquo; <a name="citation206c"></a><a href="#footnote206c"
class="citation">[206c]</a> this is the proper translation of the
passage.&nbsp; God Almighty of His infinite mercy grant, that the
words which follow this text, addressed by the Apostle to the
faithful disciples of old, may be realized by all of us here;
&ldquo;we, (says he,) are not of them who draw back unto
perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the
soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pray to God without ceasing for grace to
persevere: His Holy Spirit, if sought and cherished and used,
will enable us to be faithful and to overcome, <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>will
&ldquo;make us more than conquerors, through Him that loved
us.&rdquo; <a name="citation207a"></a><a href="#footnote207a"
class="citation">[207a]</a></p>
<p>In conclusion then, I ask, &ldquo;is not the way of the Lord
equal?&rdquo;&nbsp; And of those, who presume to arraign it, are
not the ways unequal?&nbsp; Equal and merciful do all the ways of
God appear, whenever they can be traced; equal and merciful they
are, whether they can be traced or not.&nbsp; &ldquo;O man, who
art thou that repliest against God?&rdquo; <a
name="citation207b"></a><a href="#footnote207b"
class="citation">[207b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall not the judge of
all the earth do right?&rdquo; <a name="citation207c"></a><a
href="#footnote207c" class="citation">[207c]</a>&nbsp; Humble
thyself, and accept His proffered mercy: Hear His words;
&ldquo;Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth:
for I am God, and there is none else.&rdquo; <a
name="citation207d"></a><a href="#footnote207d"
class="citation">[207d]</a>&nbsp; Salvation is all that the
sinner can desire; and surely he can repose, without doubt or
distrust upon the all-wise, all-merciful, omnipotent God.&nbsp;
Understanding and experiencing, in so many instances, the divine
wisdom and mercy, we can have no difficulty in believing, that
God &ldquo;doeth all things <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>well.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He that
spared not his own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how
shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?&rdquo; <a
name="citation208a"></a><a href="#footnote208a"
class="citation">[208a]</a>&nbsp; Most unreasonable, most
ungrateful would it be to question or complain.&nbsp; No true
believer does so: he is thoroughly convinced of the truth of
God&rsquo;s word, and the equity of God&rsquo;s dealings and
dispensations.&nbsp; This is his concern, this the great purpose
resting in his soul, to be reconciled to God in His own appointed
way; to be made an inheritor of His eternal kingdom.&nbsp; He
knows, and it is enough for him to know, that &ldquo;the grace of
God, which bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men;&rdquo;
<a name="citation208b"></a><a href="#footnote208b"
class="citation">[208b]</a> he believes, and he acts upon the
belief, that &ldquo;the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from
all sin;&rdquo; <a name="citation208c"></a><a
href="#footnote208c" class="citation">[208c]</a> he seeks to
&ldquo;wash and be clean,&rdquo; and faithfully waits for the
promised blessing: &ldquo;Verily there is a reward for the
righteous; verily He is a God that judgeth the earth.&rdquo;<a

209</span>SERMON XII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE NEW MAN.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Eph</span>. iv. 24.</p>
<p><i>That ye put on the new man</i>, <i>which after God is
created in righteousness and true holiness</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> treating of these words, it
shall be my first object to explain their real nature and
import.&nbsp; St. Paul has been describing, in this chapter, the
character of the unregenerate Gentiles, who &ldquo;walked in the
vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being
alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in
them, because of the blindness of their heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
this description applies, with almost equal force and truth, to a
considerable portion of <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>those who have &ldquo;named the name
of Christ:&rdquo; though they acknowledge with their lips the
truth and obligation of the christian religion, they still
&ldquo;walk in the vanity of their minds.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to any
saving view of the truth, &ldquo;the understanding is <i>yet</i>
darkened:&rdquo; and though their ignorance be removed, with
respect to a revelation of the divine will, they are as far as
ever from &ldquo;the life of God;&rdquo; though the mind is
enlightened with the knowledge of the fact, the blindness of the
heart remains.</p>
<p>The Apostle proceeds to say of his Ephesian converts,
&ldquo;but <i>ye</i> have not so learned
Christ&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;if so be, that ye have heard
Him&rdquo; (or rather, as the phrase may properly imply,
<i>forasmuch</i> as ye have heard Him) &ldquo;and have been
taught by Him as the truth is in Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what had
they heard, as necessary to their salvation by His name, and what
is the truth they had been taught?&mdash;&ldquo;that ye put off,
concerning the former conversation (the former life and conduct),
the old man, <a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>which is corrupt, according to the deceitful
lusts&rdquo; (the worldly principles and the sinful habits above
described, to which you were addicted before your conversion);
and &ldquo;be renewed (or made new) in the spirit of your mind;
and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
righteousness and true holiness;&rdquo; the change thus produced
being so great and important as to be compared to a new creation;
the inner man being totally different from what he was
before.&nbsp; It is said, moreover, that the new man &ldquo;is
created <i>after God</i> in righteousness;&rdquo; this is fully
explained by the same Apostle, in his Epistle to the Colossians,
where he is treating on the same subject; he there speaks of the
converts being renewed &ldquo;after the image of Him who created
them.&rdquo; <a name="citation211"></a><a href="#footnote211"
class="citation">[211]</a>&nbsp; At the creation of Adam, God is
represented as saying, &ldquo;Let us make man in our image, after
our likeness,&rdquo; that is, in perfect innocence and
purity.&nbsp; Thus was Adam formed, perfectly upright and <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>holy: by
disobedience his nature was changed; he became sinful and unholy;
and this change was entailed upon all his posterity.&nbsp; The
object, therefore, of the new creation is to restore in us, as
far as we are now capable of it, that image of divine
righteousness, which man lost by the fall.&nbsp; On considering,
then, the holy nature of God, we are at once made acquainted with
that change, in the natural man, which the gospel teaches and
requires; we are brought to perceive and acknowledge that
&ldquo;true holiness,&rdquo; which as Christians we are bound to
desire and attain.</p>
<p>The same truth may be said to have been substantially revealed
to the servants of God under the old dispensation: there is no
express mention indeed of a new creation of the individual; but
the prophets every where assert, what is similar in effect, that
no wicked person, without hearty repentance and an entire change
of character, must expect the divine favour.&nbsp; To this
purpose is the language of <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>Isaiah: &ldquo;Wash you, make you
clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes;
cease to do evil, learn to do well.&rdquo; <a
name="citation213a"></a><a href="#footnote213a"
class="citation">[213a]</a>&nbsp; The unclean and unrighteous
cannot stand before God.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I live, saith the Lord
God, (by the mouth of Ezekiel) I have no pleasure in the death of
the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn
ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, house of
Israel?&rdquo; <a name="citation213b"></a><a href="#footnote213b"
class="citation">[213b]</a>&nbsp; The prophet thereto plainly
intimating, that notwithstanding all that goodness and
long-suffering of the divine nature, which is expressed in a most
compassionate invitation, and is confirmed even by the solemnity
of an oath, yet if sinners did not &ldquo;turn from their evil
ways,&rdquo; there was no remedy, but they must die.&nbsp; And
the same prophet on another occasion, uses language very similar
to that of the text; &ldquo;I will put a <i>new</i> spirit within
you, and I will take the stony heart out of their
flesh&mdash;that they may walk in my statutes and keep mine <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>ordinances,
and do them, and they shall be my people, and I will be their
God.&rdquo; <a name="citation214a"></a><a href="#footnote214a"
class="citation">[214a]</a>&nbsp; Agreeably to this, the same
people are subsequently exhorted, to &ldquo;cast away from them
all the transgressions whereby they had transgressed, and to make
them a new heart and a new spirit.&rdquo; <a
name="citation214b"></a><a href="#footnote214b"
class="citation">[214b]</a>&nbsp; However therefore, the New
Covenant doth exceed the Old, with regard to the clearness of its
manifestations, and its fuller dispensations of grace, yet are
there in both of them the same consistent terms of reconciliation
and salvation for rebellious man; in both are injoined the same
purity of spirit, and integrity of character; this is the plain,
uniform, infallible intimation of both, that &ldquo;without
holiness no man shall see the Lord.&rdquo; <a
name="citation214c"></a><a href="#footnote214c"
class="citation">[214c]</a></p>
<p>That the people of old were but partially awake and alive to
the great change required to be wrought in them, from sin to
righteousness, from the love of evil to the love of good, from a
&ldquo;bondage unto <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>the elements of the world&rdquo; to
the glorious liberty of the children of God, is too fully proved
from the complaints of patriarchs and prophets and holy men of
every determination.&nbsp; The sound of the gospel, thank God,
has now gone forth into all lands, and brought &ldquo;life and
immortality to light;&rdquo; it has awakened many nations, who
lay fast bound in the slumbers of spiritual death; but whether it
has vitally and savingly awakened a greater proportion of those,
to whom the glad tidings have been revealed, is a matter of
reasonable doubt.&nbsp; At least, if we compare what man is by
nature, with what he may be and ought to be by divine grace, it
must appear, from the life and conduct of the great majority in
the christian world, that they have by no means attained that
renovation of spirit and principle and character, which can
entitle them to the appellation of new creatures.</p>
<p>Of how many may it be said, (and their own consciences will
bear witness to the truth of the accusation,) that their thoughts
<a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>are
ordinarily flowing in much the same channel, their passions
yielding to the same excitements, and their pursuits directed to
the same end, as they would have been, had the pure doctrines and
precepts of Christ never been promulgated.&nbsp; Vast numbers, in
the visible Church of Christ, who profess some regard for
religion, instead of raising their affections to the standard of
the gospel, are seeking to <i>bring down</i> the immoveable
standard of the gospel to <i>them</i>: and greater numbers still,
of reckless men, bestow not so much as a thought upon that
spiritual change, which is absolutely essential to the christian
character.&nbsp; For what is the religion of thousands amongst
us?&mdash;merely, if I may so call it, that traditionary
acquaintance with divine things, which is acquired in infancy;
that outward assent to evangelical truths, which was handed down
to them by their forefathers; a cold respect for the shadow,
without any concern for the substance: they are content to
observe the forms of religion, because <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>they have
been accustomed so to do, and their neighbours do the same; and
to attend to what are called the decencies of life, because they
would otherwise be disreputable; to crimes and to holiness
strangers perhaps alike; satisfied to do no worse, than they see
the multitudes around them doing; and resting their claim to
God&rsquo;s favour on a few moral pretensions, or even on the
absence of scandalous immorality; probably looking for exemption
from the penalties of the divine law, because their
transgressions have never been such, as to expose them to the
scourge of the law of man.</p>
<p>This, however deplorable, is a true description of no
inconsiderable portion of our christian land; to none of
<i>us</i>, we may hope, is the description strictly applicable;
but it is too probable, that there are many amongst us, who
partake more or less of the character here delineated; who
practically regard the christian religion as a system to be
accommodated to their dispositions and habits and pursuits of <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>life, and
not as demanding a total alteration in their views and tempers
and motives of action.&nbsp; Though their thoughts are directed
to objects, far above those of &ldquo;the heathen who know not
God&rdquo; and though their morality, upon the whole, be of a
higher order and a purer cast, yet are their affections willingly
led captive by the ensnaring vanities and engrossing interests of
this lower world: heaven is the object of their settled creed,
but it is not the main purpose to which their endeavours are
anxiously and daily directed; in balancing between this or that
pursuit, their thoughts are intent only upon providing for
&ldquo;the meat that perisheth,&rdquo; without any enquiry or
concern, how they may best provide for &ldquo;that which endureth
unto eternal life.&rdquo; <a name="citation218"></a><a
href="#footnote218" class="citation">[218]</a>&nbsp; And the
morality, on which they so complacently rest, has frequently no
connexion whatever with the christian faith; referable rather to
philosophy than the gospel, to &ldquo;the praise of men <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>than the
praise of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence it follows, that their moral
obedience is lamentably defective; extending only to the
performance of those duties, which least oppose their inclination
or their temporal advantage; while even such duties are but
imperfectly discharged.&nbsp; Their self-government is wretchedly
defective; the controul of their thoughts, the mastery over their
passions, the command over their tongue, are attainments which
they seldom bind it upon their conscience to acquire.&nbsp; And
though they be turned from idols to worship the living and the
true God, the fruit of their service, as well as the irregularity
of it, affords but too clear a proof, that they &ldquo;worship
him not in spirit and in truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; However improved, in
their moral character, by their acquaintance with the christian
religion, they cannot possibly have imbibed its spirit; nor have
arrived at that happy change of the natural man, which can be
denominated by a new creation.&nbsp; They are working out, or
rather <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>seeking to work out, their salvation on maxims of human
expediency, and in accommodation to human interests; not with
&ldquo;fear and trembling,&rdquo; lest they should lose the
inestimable prize; they are not evincing, that it is &ldquo;God
that worketh in them both to will and to do.&rdquo; <a
name="citation220"></a><a href="#footnote220"
class="citation">[220]</a></p>
<p>I have thus enlarged, on the presents occasion, upon the
enormous deficiencies of christian character, because it is of
great importance for us to understand, what is not accordant with
the principles of the gospel, as well as what is: it is of vital
consequence, that we should be thoroughly aware of the
insufficiency of that spirit and view, of those maxims and
motives of those habits and observances, which pass current for
religion in the world.</p>
<p>We cannot put on the new man, unless we put off the old; and
we cannot put off the old, unless we thoroughly understand in
what it consists.&nbsp; The work is too commonly supposed much
easier and much less comprehensive, than it really is: <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>many
vicious habits may be corrected, without any essential or
fundamental alteration of character.&nbsp; A man may become weary
of the pursuits, disgusted with the follies, worn and sated with
the profligacies of life; he may find his circumstances
impoverished, his reputation impaired, his worldly interest
obstructed: and such considerations as these may generate a
purpose of moral reform.&nbsp; Or the sinner may feel himself
oppressed with the increasing weight of years; infirmities are
coming fast upon him; and his conscience, in many a whisper of
fear, tells him that something should be done, some preparation
made, for the world to which he is hastening, for the account
which he will speedily be called to render.&nbsp; The idea of
dying with those depravities, to which he has clinged through
life, is awful and insupportable.&nbsp; The more flagrant of them
are accordingly corrected; and the rest, which are less startling
and disquieting, are undisturbedly retained.&nbsp; In all this
there is no change of principle, <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>no vital alteration: the old man
continues; less hideous in features and outward appearance, but
the very same in reality.&nbsp; With this partial renovation the
mind is satisfied; the conscience is becalmed; the sinner
dies.</p>
<p>Through the &ldquo;deceivableness of unrighteousness,&rdquo;
through the wiles of Satan and the evil propensity of our own
hearts, we are always in danger of being too easily content with
our spiritual condition; we look too much to the outward and
visible form, and too little within; to little to the habitual
principle, the constraining motive, the cast of character: and it
is in this, that the difference between the old and the new man,
in the christian world essentially consists.&nbsp; Suffer me to
point out again a few of the broad lines of distinction.&nbsp;
The old man, whatever of religion he may profess, lives
principally for himself and the world; he may think of religion,
and speak of it, and pray for it with the lips, but it has no
dwelling place in his heart, is not the <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>business of
his life.&nbsp; However observable, in many respects, his moral
deportment may be, his character is seldom consistent.&nbsp; From
some evil pursuits he abstains, in others he wilfully and
constantly indulges; some evil passions are kept in creditable
order, others are let loose; some duties he professedly performs,
and others he professedly omits.&nbsp; And nothing is done with a
true christian motive, or christian view; nothing from a sense of
absolute and uncompromising obedience to the will of God.&nbsp;
Nor is it surprising, that there should be such deficiencies and
inconsistencies in his character; he has no principle or means,
by which he can possibly walk uprightly with his God.&nbsp; He
does not &ldquo;believe with the heart unto righteousness;&rdquo;
he does not seek, nor desire, to &ldquo;live in the spirit and
walk in the spirit;&rdquo; there is no life in his devotion, no
sincerity in his prayer: he &ldquo;asks not faithfully&rdquo; for
repentance and holiness, and they cannot be &ldquo;effectually
received.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is not disposed to bring his
understanding <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>and heart into subjection to the divine will.&nbsp; He
studies not that holy word, which ministers the principle of a
divine life, and the spirit of obedience to the soul.&nbsp; He
lives for earth and not for heaven.&nbsp; He is too proud to be
taught the humiliating doctrines of revelation; too full of
himself, to bow implicitly to his Redeemer.&nbsp; In a word,
nature is his book and not the Bible; the world is his teacher
and not the Spirit of God; earthly and not spiritual subjects are
the delight of his heart; he walks not &ldquo;by faith, but by
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new man is the reverse of all this; he humbles himself, as
a sinner, at the foot of the cross, under a deep sense of his own
guilt and the divine mercy; desirous only to be reconciled and
saved; he constantly studies the mysteries God&rsquo;s word, with
a submissive understanding and an obedient heart; he rests his
only hope on the merit of a Redeemer, whose promises and whose
law he receives with all his mind and soul and strength; <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>he prays
&ldquo;without ceasing&rdquo; for the Holy Spirit, is directed by
His teaching, supported by His power, and comforted by His
heavenly illumination.&nbsp; Doubtless he must live <i>in</i> the
world, and <i>by</i> the world, as well as other people; but he
does not live <i>for</i> the world; his heart is not there, his
delight is not there; he is a redeemed pilgrim, journeying in a
far country, returning to his Father&rsquo;s house; and his heart
is musing on the &ldquo;many mansions&rdquo; there, and full of
the inspiring influential hope, that one of them is prepared for
him.</p>
<p>Such holy principles are continually manifested by a
determination of purpose, a decisiveness of character, a devoted
spirit of uniform obedience to the revealed will of God.&nbsp; As
the conscience bears witness, so does the life: &ldquo;the tree
is known by its fruit;&rdquo; all evil affections are resolutely
mortified, all sinful pleasures and pursuits utterly
abandoned.&nbsp; The sincere Christian, the new man, has an
earnest desire and care upon his soul, to be &ldquo;righteous
before God, walking in all the commandments <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>and
ordinances of the Lord blameless.&rdquo; <a
name="citation226a"></a><a href="#footnote226a"
class="citation">[226a]</a>&nbsp; For this blessing he daily
prays; in this work he daily advances: &ldquo;loving the Lord God
with all his heart,&rdquo; and &ldquo;loving his neighbour as
himself,&rdquo; he is of all men the most inclined, as he is
assuredly the most bound, to &ldquo;live soberly, righteously and
godly in this present world.&rdquo; <a name="citation226b"></a><a
href="#footnote226b" class="citation">[226b]</a></p>
<p>These remarks suggest the necessity of further admonition on
this head.&nbsp; Many persons have been led to entertain
enthusiastic notions on the subject of the new man, the new
creation, the new birth.&nbsp; They have supposed it principally
to consist in certain inward experiences or feelings, which they
have been enabled to trace to some particular event or period:
the Holy Spirit, as they believe, then beginning, for the first
time, to work upon their understandings and hearts; and thus
leaving an indelible impression, the seal of their redemption,
the earnest of their certain acceptance with God.&nbsp; Far are
we from <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>denying, that such sudden conversions may and do take
place: still farther from denying that, whether sudden or
gradual, a change from the old to the new man is attributable to
the aid of a divine energy and power.&nbsp; It is, properly
speaking, a new creation; the imparting of a new nature: and
cannot be effected without the hand of the original Creator:
without the operation of that Spirit, which &ldquo;moved upon the
face of the waters,&rdquo; which &ldquo;breathed into the
nostrils the breath of life, so that man became a living
soul.&rdquo; <a name="citation227a"></a><a href="#footnote227a"
class="citation">[227a]</a>&nbsp; Our Liturgy has correctly and
fully embodied the testimony of scripture, on this as on other
points: we are taught to pray, that God will &ldquo;<i>create</i>
in us new and contrite hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp; This blessing must
proceed from that Holy Spirit, who still in His ordinary
dispensations, as formerly in His miraculous gifts,
&ldquo;divides unto every man severally as He will;&rdquo; <a
name="citation227b"></a><a href="#footnote227b"
class="citation">[227b]</a> not as it were capriciously, but
according to His own infinite wisdom <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>and goodness, as He judges expedient
to the case of each individual.&nbsp; But this divine grace is
not communicated for the mere purpose of producing a glowing
affection, a familiar experience, an enraptured view of spiritual
things: nor can any inward feelings alone prove that such grace
has been administered at all: the proof must be manifested, in
the way pointed out by the text: the new man &ldquo;is created,
after God, in <i>righteousness and true
holiness</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; A holy character and a righteous life
are the proper and indispensable evidences of such a change; a
faithful walking with God, a sober self-government, an upright
dealing with all mankind.</p>
<p>I counsel you, my brethren, in the language of truth and the
spirit of affection, to be content with no other evidence:
equally far be you removed from that carnal profession of the
gospel, which despises or neglects the mighty change required of
every sincere believer; and from those fanciful notions of
spiritual <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>experience, which leave the heart and the character
arrayed in the spotted garment of sin: both in the one case and
the other, you will be &ldquo;grieving the spirit,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;quenching the spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; In your principles and
life, as well as in your views and affections and desires,
&ldquo;let old things pass away, and all things become
new;&rdquo; <a name="citation229a"></a><a href="#footnote229a"
class="citation">[229a]</a> &ldquo;put off the old man with the
deceitful lusts,&rdquo; and thus let the new man be put on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Abhor that which is evil: cleave to that which is
good.&rdquo; <a name="citation229b"></a><a href="#footnote229b"
class="citation">[229b]</a>&nbsp; This is the method ordained of
God, by which we are to &ldquo;work out our salvation;&rdquo;
this our plain, this our necessary duty.&nbsp; Pray we fervently,
strive we diligently, that we may be thus effectually turned from
sin to holiness, &ldquo;from darkness to light, from the power of
Satan unto God.&rdquo; <a name="citation229c"></a><a

<h2><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>SERMON XIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE WEDDING GARMENT.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Matt</span>. xxii. 2.</p>
<p><i>The kingdom of heaven is like unto certain king which made
a marriage for his son</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is my intention, in this
discourse, to explain the several particulars of the parable
before us; which may be regarded, in the <i>first</i> place, as
descriptive of the dispensation of the gospel to the people of
Israel and the world at large; and, in the <i>second</i> place,
as instructing us in that peculiar fitness necessary to all, who
shall be admitted to enjoy the privileges and happiness of the
kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The state of the gospel, our Saviour informs us, may be
compared to the conduct of a king at the marriage of his son; <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>or rather,
as the meaning is, at the marriage <i>feast</i> which he gave on
that occasion: the circumstances which might, in that case, be
supposed to occur, aptly represent a variety of particulars
belonging to the gospel dispensation.</p>
<p>Before, however, we enter upon the parable, it may be
remarked, that spiritual blessings are frequently set forth in
the holy scriptures, under allusions to feasting and
refreshment.&nbsp; Thus Solomon of old: &ldquo;Wisdom hath
builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: she hath
killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also
furnished her table.&nbsp; Come, eat of my bread, and drink of
the wine which I have mingled.&nbsp; Forsake the foolish, and
live; and go in the way of understanding.&rdquo; <a
name="citation231"></a><a href="#footnote231"
class="citation">[231]</a>&nbsp; And thus the prophet Isaiah, in
describing the state of the gospel: &ldquo;In this mountain shall
the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a
feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of
wines on <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>the lees well refined.&rdquo; <a
name="citation232a"></a><a href="#footnote232a"
class="citation">[232a]</a>&nbsp; And thus our blessed Lord
Himself: &ldquo;I appoint unto you a kingdom, as My Father hath
appointed unto Me, that ye may eat and drink at My table in My
kingdom.&rdquo; <a name="citation232b"></a><a
href="#footnote232b" class="citation">[232b]</a></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Let us now proceed with the parable: &ldquo;He sent
forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding
(feast); and they would not come.&rdquo;&nbsp; This probably
alludes to the first period of the promulgation of the gospel;
under the preaching of John the Baptist and of the earliest
disciples; the former endeavouring to prepare the hearts of men
for the kingdom and coming of Christ; and the latter proclaiming
His glorious arrival, preaching the truth of His gospel, and
confirming the word by a display of miraculous power.&nbsp; But
the Jews had been a carnal people, &ldquo;holding the truth in
unrighteousness;&rdquo; and they refused to give ear to those
holy instructions, which called upon them to &ldquo;lay the axe
to the root of all sin,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;bring <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>forth
fruits meet for repentance.&rdquo; <a name="citation233a"></a><a
href="#footnote233a" class="citation">[233a]</a>&nbsp; This it
was that prevented them, not only from a cordial acceptance of
the gospel, but even from a fair examination and inquiry; they
would not listen to such doctrine; their heart was decided
against it: to this it was owing, these carnal habits and views,
that when their Messiah came, they were not ready to receive Him
in the way which He required.&nbsp; Ready enough were they to
admit Him in their own way; agreeably to their own notions and
desires, as an earthly conqueror, as the dispenser of temporal
blessings and rewards; but not as the abolisher of sin; not as a
preacher of righteousness; not as a herald, announcing to them
the necessity of holiness in this world, and the inheritance of
glory in the world to come.&nbsp; Not all His amazing miracles,
not all His fulfilment of their own prophecies, not all the power
of His word, could convince their understandings; because they
had &ldquo;an evil heart of unbelief:&rdquo; <a
name="citation233b"></a><a href="#footnote233b"
class="citation">[233b]</a> and therefore, <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>notwithstanding His awful warnings, His earnest and
affectionate invitations, &ldquo;they would not come&rdquo; unto
Him, that they might find rest unto their souls.</p>
<p>Here we behold, as in a glass, the real ground of every
rejection of the Saviour in every age; it is not because men deny
His excellency, or His power, or His mercy, or the greatness of
His kingdom: it is because they &ldquo;love this present evil
world,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;god of this world hath blinded their
minds,&rdquo; <a name="citation234a"></a><a href="#footnote234a"
class="citation">[234a]</a> through the deceitfulness of
sin.&nbsp; Even though eternal salvation is offered them, and
they do not disbelieve it; still, awful to think! the Saviour is
rejected for perishable interests and sensual indulgences.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He feedeth on ashes; a deceived heart hath turned him
aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, is there not a
lie in my right hand?&rdquo; <a name="citation234b"></a><a
href="#footnote234b" class="citation">[234b]</a>&nbsp; Men walk
on in darkness because they love it; and they &ldquo;love
darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil.&rdquo;
<a name="citation234c"></a><a href="#footnote234c"
class="citation">[234c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>2.&nbsp; But the Jews were not yet cast off, without
further admonition and entreaty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Again He sent forth
other servants, saying, tell them who are bidden, behold I have
prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all
things are ready; come unto the marriage&rdquo; feast.&nbsp; But
&ldquo;they made light of it,&rdquo; and offered a variety of
groundless excuses.&nbsp; This may chiefly refer to the fuller
manifestation of the gospel, after the resurrection and ascension
of our blessed Lord; for the parable, as we shall more clearly
perceive in the sequel, is partly of a prophetic nature; and
intended to represent to the Jews their persevering spirit of
obstinacy, and the punishment which would ensue; that some of
them at least, when the fulness of the time should come, might be
struck with the force of this predictive representation, and be
converted to the &ldquo;truth as it is in Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every thing requisite for the sumptuous feast was liberally
provided: in the days of the apostles, abundant indeed was the
confirmation of the truth and doctrines of <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>the gospel;
bright the manifestation of heavenly glory, that was shed abroad
upon it.&nbsp; Then were strikingly fulfilled the words of their
prophet Joel; &ldquo;I will pour out My Spirit upon all
flesh&mdash;also upon the servants and the handmaids in those
days will I pour out My Spirit.&rdquo; <a
name="citation236"></a><a href="#footnote236"
class="citation">[236]</a>&nbsp; Accordingly the gifts of the
Holy Ghost&mdash;were openly poured forth, and mighty were the
deeds done and the words spoken by His servants, under the
operation of His marvellous power: the old dispensation was fully
brought to bear upon the new: it was shewn how the character of
Jesus corresponded, in His birth and life and death and
resurrection and ascension, as well as in His offices of Priest
and Mediator and King, with various prophecies and types
exhibited in the ancient scriptures.&nbsp; The benefits and
blessings of the christian dispensation were more particularly
and largely set forth: the feast was fully displayed before them,
in all its rich and magnificent abundance.&nbsp; Many <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>were then
induced to enter into the guest chamber, and partake of the
heavenly repast; but many more, the Jewish nation at large, made
light of it, and went their way.&nbsp; And not only so: not only
was the invitation unheeded and despised; but the remnant, that
is, some who were not content with disobeying the call,
&ldquo;took his servants, and entreated them spitefully and slew
them;&rdquo; persecuted the disciples even unto death.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; We now come to a part of the parable, which must of
necessity receive a prophetic interpretation: &ldquo;When the
King heard thereof, he was wroth, and he sent forth his armies
and destroyed those murderers, and burnt up their
city.&rdquo;&nbsp; This plainly points out the Roman armies
ravaging Judea, destroying Jerusalem, and putting the inhabitants
to the sword; an event, which did not take place till many years
after.&nbsp; Neither, in truth, is there mention made, in the
gospel history, of the Jews having slain any of the disciples,
whilst their Lord was with them.&nbsp; They <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>were
murderers of the Son of God, and of many of His apostles and
disciples after Him; thus &ldquo;filling up the measure of their
iniquity,&rdquo; and drawing down upon themselves, and their
nation at large, the most tremendous visitation of divine wrath,
ever inflicted in this world upon a rebellious people.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; We are next carried forward to another period in the
gospel dispensation; a period in which we ourselves are deeply
and peculiarly interested; from which we date all the spiritual
mercies and advantages, all &ldquo;the means of grace and hopes
of glory,&rdquo; which have been vouchsafed to our souls.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then saith the king to his servants, the wedding (the
wedding feast) is ready, but they which were bidden were not
worthy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Israelites who were honoured, as the
people of God, with the first invitation and call to the gospel,
shewed themselves unworthy of it, by their ungrateful and
obstinate rejection.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go ye therefore into the
highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the
marriage&rdquo; <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>feast: go ye, as we may interpret the words of our
Lord, go ye, My ministers and messengers, into the world at
large, and carry My invitation to the Gentiles; to as many as ye
shall find; and proclaim to them that My table is spread for all:
since the people, who were first bidden, have &ldquo;not heard
when I spake, nor answered, when I called,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;kingdom of heaven is now thrown open to all
believers,&rdquo; so that &ldquo;whosoever shall call upon the
name of the Lord shall be saved:&rdquo; My kingdom shall no
longer be confined to one peculiar race; the time is come, when
the blessedness of it shall be diffused abroad as &ldquo;the
waters cover the sea:&rdquo;&nbsp; I am ready to &ldquo;make a
covenant with all flesh&rdquo;&mdash;a covenant of peace&mdash;of
benefits and mercies, such as their &ldquo;eyes have never seen,
nor ears heard;&rdquo; the universal banquet is spread; bid them
all to come.&nbsp; &ldquo;So those servants went out into the
highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both
bad and good: and the wedding (table) was furnished <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>with
guests:&rdquo; for it was not unusual, we must observe, in those
countries, for men of the highest rank and distinction to admit
to their tables, on remarkable occasions, persons of the lowest
condition.</p>
<p>And this part of the parable also was representative of a
future period; for though Christ had received homage from some in
the Gentile world, and had signified His favour to others as well
as the Jews, it could not be said, that the blessings of His
gospel were at that time distinctly offered to the world at
large.&nbsp; By St. Peter, in the first instance, in the case of
Cornelius, and afterwards more fully by St. Paul, the Apostle of
the Gentiles, were the good tidings universally announced and
spread.&nbsp; This accords with the invitation in the parable,
where we find that no exceptions were to be made: the
&ldquo;servants gathered together all, both bad and good;&rdquo;
thus, to men of all characters and descriptions the gospel was
indiscriminately preached: the best greatly <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>needed it;
and even to the worst the door of grace and repentance was
opened.</p>
<p>Doubtless, there are vast differences in the characters of
unregenerate men, of the very heathen &ldquo;who know not
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some will use, more faithfully than others, the
feebler light of natural religion; and thus arrive at a higher
state of moral rectitude and respectability.&nbsp; But whatever
comparative excellence any one may attain, in such a state, he is
at best a polluted sinner: fallen from the favour and family of
God; without the power to rise and return; the inheritor of sin
and death, without the means of salvation.&nbsp; God must be
reconciled, and the gate of mercy thrown open; or the sinner must
perish.&nbsp; And it is for the offended God alone, to appoint
the means of reconciliation; and proclaim the conditions of
pardon and mercy.&nbsp; Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, is
the only means of deliverance; by His incarnation and sacrifice
has atonement been made for man; &ldquo;there is no other name
under heaven <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>given among men, whereby we must be saved;&rdquo; <a
name="citation242a"></a><a href="#footnote242a"
class="citation">[242a]</a> &ldquo;other foundation can no man
lay.&rdquo; <a name="citation242b"></a><a href="#footnote242b"
class="citation">[242b]</a>&nbsp; The moralist must lay aside his
vain pretensions, and humble himself at the foot of the cross;
must come to the Saviour and learn of Him; come and be
&ldquo;baptised for the remission of sins;&rdquo; come, that his
character may be essentially changed by the Spirit and the word
of God; that he may have new desires, new affections, new
principles, new prospects: and many of &ldquo;the children of
this world,&rdquo; amiable in their disposition and reputable in
their conduct, deceive themselves in this matter; perceive not
their need of a Saviour, &ldquo;trusting in themselves that they
are righteous;&rdquo; good in their own eyes, good in the
estimation of their neighbours, they undervalue and neglect the
gospel; and therefore still continue &ldquo;dead in trespasses
and sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the bad as well as the good were gathered together; not
only to those, whose conduct had been honourable among men, <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>and whose
characters were fair; but to notorious delinquent, yea, even to
the worst of sinners, the door of the guest-chamber is open; all
are invited; all, if they will comply with the conditions and
rules of the feast, shall be fed; publicans and sinners,
extortioners and unjust, disobedient and reprobate, all are the
objects of the Saviour&rsquo;s mercy; &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye
that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you
rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; The invitation is free and universal; none who
rightly seek admission, shall be excluded.&nbsp; This exactly
agrees with the language of the evangelical prophet: &ldquo;Ho,
every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath
no money; come ye, buy and eat.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the
wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and
let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him;
and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.&rdquo; <a
name="citation243a"></a><a href="#footnote243a"
class="citation">[243a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The fountain is opened
for sin and for cleanness;&rdquo; <a name="citation243b"></a><a
href="#footnote243b" class="citation">[243b]</a> &ldquo;wash you,
make you <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>clean;&rdquo; laden as ye are with iniquity come but to
your Saviour, in sincerity and truth, with a contrite and
repentant heart; come, as He has invited you; look to the
all-sufficiency of His sacrifice; believe in Him for
justification and life; be ready to learn of His example and to
receive His spirit and His law into your heart, and you shall be
admitted to His holy banquet, and be made welcome at His table;
you shall find comfort in the presence of your Lord, and in them
&ldquo;that sit at meat with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; We are now led to the last and most striking part of
this parable: the king came in to see the guests; to see whether
they conducted themselves worthily of his entertainment, and
appeared in the dress which he had provided, for such as were
unable to furnish themselves.&nbsp; And thus, with regard to the
heavenly feast, the guests are strictly and constantly
accountable for their behaviour.&nbsp; Our blessed Lord watches
the demeanour of all who profess to accept His invitation in the
gospel; <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>observes, how every one, who is &ldquo;admitted into
the fellowship of His religion,&rdquo; fulfils the conditions
required of him.&nbsp; Nor is it the external demeanour alone,
which engages His notice and inspection; He sees through the
innermost windings of every heart, and will infallibly
&ldquo;judge righteous judgment.&rdquo;&nbsp; No violation of His
will, in thought, or word, or deed; no insincerity or deceitful
appearance can possibly remain undetected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the king came in&mdash;he saw there a man who had
not on a wedding garment.&nbsp; And he said unto him, friend, how
earnest thou in hither, not having a wedding
garment?&rdquo;&nbsp; The man could not pretend to offer an
excuse: he knew the rules of the feast, and had wantonly
neglected them; he was, like many other ungrateful people,
regaling himself upon a benefactor&rsquo;s bounty, but shewed him
no respect or regard: being therefore self-condemned, &ldquo;he
was speechless.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus will it be with every negligent
and disobedient Christian, when the Lord comes <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>to make
enquiry into his character: to justify himself, he will feel to
be impossible; thoroughly has he known his Lord&rsquo;s will, and
full often has his conscience reproved him for not performing it:
there will be nothing left for him, but unavailing sorrow and
speechless remorse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then said the king to the servants, bind him hand and
foot; and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cast him,
from the lighted chamber, to the darkness of the night without,
where he shall bitterly regret the pleasures he has so foolishly
lost.&nbsp; Sad emblem of that state, whose sadness can be known,
here upon earth, only by emblematical representation, only by
such figures as &ldquo;outer darkness,&rdquo; as the &ldquo;worm
that never dies,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the fire that never shall be
quenched;&rdquo; a darkness of mind, in the utter regions of
despair, without a ray from heaven to cheer it; the worm of
anguish preying upon the soul; and a fire burning, whether
without or within, or both; raging yet not <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>consuming.&nbsp; God grant, that we may hear only of
this wretched state &ldquo;by, the hearing of the ear;&rdquo;
that our eyes may never behold it; that none of us may be
consigned to this abode of unredeemed and unredeemable misery:
and, that we never may, let us &ldquo;walk worthy of our
vocation;&rdquo; of the Lord of that heavenly feast, of which we
are professing to partake.&nbsp; Put on, my brethren, the wedding
garment of the gospel; put it on, or intrude not into the
presence-chamber of your Lord; dread the doom of the hypocrite
and the despiser; pretend not to partake of the heavenly feast,
to expect any of the blessings of the gospel, unless ye consent
and seek to be clothed with the raiment provided by your King;
with all those christian graces and virtues, which He will enable
you to obtain.</p>
<p>If indeed it depended upon ourselves, &ldquo;miserable and
poor and naked&rdquo; as we are, to provide a suitable covering;
if the sinner were required to produce, from his own store, the
raiment of holiness and <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>righteousness, and thus make himself
acceptable to his Saviour and his God; then would he have much
reason to urge for his unworthiness and deficiency: for he has no
means of making any such provision; he has not &ldquo;wherewith
he shall come before the Lord:&rdquo; his heart is corrupt; his
character is unholy; and he has no power to change them.&nbsp;
But the provision does not depend upon ourselves; what the Lord
commands us to be clothed with, He has mercifully prepared: He
gives His Holy Spirit, to change the heart and reform the
character; to enable us to &ldquo;put off the old man with the
deceitful lusts, and to put on the new man, which after God is
created in righteousness and true holiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
spiritual clothing the Lord offers to all His followers; and woe
be to those, who refuse or slight it: for this is a contempt of
His divine mercy; a defiance of His authority and command: the
expectation of His favour, on such terms, is adding insult to
presumption.&nbsp; If we do make a profession of belonging <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>to Him, let
us not thus foolishly cast away our hope; let us not deceive
ourselves by imagining, that we can possibly maintain a title to
the privileges and blessings of the gospel, whilst we are living
in the neglect of those ordinances and laws, which the Lord has
graciously appointed as the means of our acceptance with
Him.&nbsp; They who neglect the means, will assuredly lose the
end; will be numbered among the despisers of their
Saviour&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>And in order to keep alive in our minds that deep concern,
which so momentous a subject demands, frequently let us be
meditating upon that awful hour, when the King shall come in to
visit and inspect His guests: His eye shall be upon every one,
and every one&rsquo;s eye upon Him; imagine yourself then in the
guest-chamber without a wedding garment; ready and desirous to
sink into the earth; but there will be nothing to cover your
guilt and shame: though you have entered in with the other
guests, and taken <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>your station at the feast, you will be called out from
among them, and everlastingly separated from the goodly
company.&nbsp; A garment you would then, no doubt, most willingly
accept; but it will be too late; it should have been accepted
when offered; the season of grace will be past; the time for
judgment will be come.</p>
<p>My brethren, you have professedly accepted the invitation of
your Lord; you have entered into the guest-chamber; and if you be
not already clothed with the spiritual apparel, provided by His
grace and mercy, delay not an instant to apply for it: the King
may come sooner than you expect; I pray that He come not, before
you are ready to meet Him.&nbsp; And where is this garment to be
found?&nbsp; Seek His Holy Spirit; search His Holy word: you will
then not fail to find it, and He will dispose you to put it
on.&nbsp; Repent and believe; love and obey: &ldquo;cease to do
evil, learn to do well;&rdquo; thus &ldquo;adorn the doctrine of
God your Saviour in all <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>things.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then you
will finally be admitted to the heavenly feast; to the marriage
supper of the Lamb; to the company of angels; in the courts of
uncreated light&mdash;&ldquo;for the glory of God doth lighten
them, and the Lamb is the light thereof;&rdquo; <a
name="citation251a"></a><a href="#footnote251a"

fulness of joy, and at whose right hand there are pleasures for

<span class="GutSmall">WALK WORTHY OF THE LORD, BE FRUITFUL, AND
INCREASING.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Col</span>. i. 10.</p>
<p><i>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all
pleasing</i>, <i>being fruitful in every good work</i>, <i>and
increasing in the know ledge of God</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the great objects of St.
Paul, in writing his epistles, appears to be considerably
overlooked by the christian world at large: it was, to lead those
churches and communities, in which the true foundation of
Christianity had been laid, to build upon it a corresponding
character and life.&nbsp; Certainly, a great portion of the
epistles is occupied in the assertion and explanation of
christian doctrine; <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>and this, principally, with a view
to remove certain errors and prejudices, which the members of
some churches had entertained; and upon which they had requested
the apostle&rsquo;s decision.&nbsp; But well knowing how apt the
human mind is to rest satisfied with speculative views and
persuasions, he never omits to remind his converts, that much
more was necessary than the profession of a true faith; that in
vain would their opinions be rectified, unless their heart was
also changed; that though they had &ldquo;all faith and all
knowledge,&rdquo; it would &ldquo;profit them nothing,&rdquo;
unless the graces and virtues of their holy religion were
signally manifest in their lives.</p>
<p>There is scarcely an epistle, in which the apostle does not
labour, with the most intense desire, with the most full and
repeated and peremptory injunctions, to press upon them this
momentous consideration: there is not, in the word of God, a more
complete digest and code of christian duty, than in the writings
of St. <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>Paul; and yet they are, by many, almost exclusively
regarded as an exposition of deep and mysterious doctrines; as if
this were the sole end and purpose for which they were
composed.&nbsp; Well would it have been for the christian world,
if as much attention had been paid to the practical, as to the
theoretical subjects in these divine oracles: we should not then
have witnessed so many disputations, in which charity has been
lost sight of, nor so much of the &ldquo;form of godliness
without the power;&rdquo; so many religious terms and
denominations, of which the ignorant have understood little but
the name: we should have had less of sect, of party, of invidious
distinctions of any kind; and more of vital religion amongst
us.&nbsp; But it is now, as it ever was, with fallen and
degenerate man; he is fonder of exhibiting the powers of his
understanding, of exciting his feelings, and of displaying the
pride of spiritual knowledge, than of reforming his principles
and regulating his conduct: he has therefore directed his <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>view to the
mystery of the foundation, and overlooked the directions for
raising and completing the superstructure.</p>
<p>Not that the various revelations of doctrine, in the writings
of St. Paul, are by any means to be lightly regarded; nor that
they do not demand the most reverential attention and profound
enquiry: it is of high importance for us to attain a &ldquo;right
judgment in all things:&rdquo; yet doubtless it would tend more
to the edification of Christians in general, if they took greater
heed to the rules and precepts of the divine law, to the evidence
and fruit of their faith; and to all that neglect them, we would
say, &ldquo;these things ought ye to have done, and not to leave
the others undone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passage of scripture, from which we are now discoursing,
will exemplify these remarks.&nbsp; St. Paul, in the very opening
of his epistle, assures the Colossians, that since the day he
heard of their conversion, he did &ldquo;not cease to pray for
them and to desire that they might be <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>filled with the knowledge of the
will of God, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that they
might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful
in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &ldquo;That ye might walk worthy of the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is scarcely possible for the most cursory
observer not to perceive, that the faith of the gospel cannot be
truly embraced with indifference; that the christian name is not
a mere honorary or professional title, independent of obligations
and of consequences.&nbsp; As the Bible is rich in promises, so
is it also clear and necessitating, in the conditions upon which
those promises are made: as the Redeemer has freely offered unto
us the benefits of His cross, so has He as plainly injoined upon
us the indispensable duty of &ldquo;taking up our own cross
daily,&rdquo; and &ldquo;following the blessed steps of His most
holy life;&rdquo; as He has reconciled us unto the Father, and
again adopted us into the blessed family above, so are we
required, if we <a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>have any part or lot in this matter, to be-have as
children, who have recovered the forfeited privileges of their
glorious inheritance, and &ldquo;have their conversation in
heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; As we have been &ldquo;bought at so great a
price,&rdquo; we must continue the subjects and the property of
the &ldquo;Lord that bought us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No man, whose nature, whose principles, whose affections,
whose life, remain unchanged; no man, enthralled by the pleasures
and devoted to the pursuits of a thoughtless and corrupt world,
can justly consider himself as an actual partaker of the
covenanted mercies of God.&nbsp; He may have been admitted by
baptism into Christ&rsquo;s visible church; he may hope to
render, at some future day, his baptismal privilege available to
salvation; but every page of God&rsquo;s revealed word would
forbid him to regard himself as an accepted &ldquo;inheritor of
the kingdom of heaven,&rdquo; while his life is palpably at
variance with the conditions upon which that inheritance is
vouchsafed; while it is contradictory to <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>the laws,
and totally inconsistent with the blessings, which the Saviour
has proclaimed to mankind.&nbsp; Every man must not only perceive
from the gospel, but be assured by his own reason and conscience,
that such divine mercies absolutely require and imply some degree
of worthiness; some correspondence in his views, his temper, and
his conduct.</p>
<p>Worthy indeed, in the fullest sense of the word, of such
transcendent love and favour, of life and immortality, of
everlasting honour in the presence of the pure and perfect
Creator, the degenerate creature can never be; he has sinned; and
&ldquo;the wages of sin is death.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there is a
fitness, which the Christian, by divine help, must attain; a
humility and contrition of heart; a sincere belief in God&rsquo;s
mercy through Christ; a grateful sense of God&rsquo;s undeserved
goodness; a desire of recovery from the ruin of his fallen
nature; and withal, a true spirit of acquiescence in those means
of grace, and that revealed law, ordained to bring the sinner to
his <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>Maker; and this conformity, in the character of man, is
frequently represented in scripture by the name of
<i>worthiness</i>: he becomes worthy in this respect, inasmuch as
he fulfils the conditions of the gospel covenant, and is thereby
rendered a fit object of God&rsquo;s free mercy: without this
character he would be unworthy, inasmuch as he would shew himself
unmoved by the marvellous loving-kindness of his Saviour; would
shew, that he had no real value for the blessings, which the
gospel places within his reach; no regard for the revelation and
ordinances of God.&nbsp; It is an observation as true as it is
common, that the holy gospel designs not to save us <i>in</i> our
sins, but <i>from</i> them; we must therefore be made willing and
desirous and careful, to subdue the prevalence of sin, or we
cannot attain unto salvation; and if the dominion of evil be
subdued, there will grow up, in our hearts and lives, the
manifold fruits of righteousness.</p>
<p>Such was the worthiness, which the apostle prayed and laboured
to produce <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>in the early disciples; and if, without this, we are
hoping to be accepted of the Lord, &ldquo;we are deceiving
ourselves, and the truth is not in us.&rdquo;&nbsp; The meetness
indeed, of which we are speaking, is not exclusively our own; it
must &ldquo;be wrought in us of God;&rdquo; still it is to be
sought by prayer, and improved with diligence: &ldquo;We are not
sufficient of ourselves to think any thing, as of ourselves; but
our sufficiency is of God;&rdquo; <a name="citation260"></a><a
href="#footnote260" class="citation">[260]</a> yet God will not
fail to supply us with the means, if we pray for them and use
them faithfully.</p>
<p>To this statement I request your especial attention; because
there are professing Christians, who take an improper view of
this important matter.&nbsp; Conscious of their own unworthiness
in point of <i>merit</i>, they are apt to overlook that worthy
<i>fitness</i>, of heart and character and life, which is
necessary for every sincere follower, of Christ.&nbsp; The
proclamations of their own undeservings, and their
Saviour&rsquo;s free love, are sometimes so loud and frequent, <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>as to lower
in their minds the sense of moral and spiritual obligation, as to
make them relax in their duly to God and man; as if they were
privileged to offend, because they extolled the Saviour, and
debased themselves.&nbsp; This is a vain and a fanatical spirit:
Christ alone is worthy to save; but we must endeavour, by His
sanctifying aid, in all things to be made more and more worthy of
the exceeding &ldquo;riches of His grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; And, in order to encourage us in the goodly work, the
Almighty, whose happiness is infinite and incapable of increase,
graciously represents Himself as <i>pleased</i>, even with our
imperfect services: &ldquo;That ye might walk worthy of the Lord
unto all pleasing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Though the heavens are not
pure in His sight,&rdquo; yet does He condescend to &ldquo;visit
man&rdquo; with His favour, and &ldquo;to regard the son of
man,&rdquo; who serveth Him, with an approving eye: He is
pleased, because it is the fruit of the sinner&rsquo;s
reconciliation, by the death and sufferings of His beloved Son:
for His <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>sake, even the feeble struggles of the Christian, in
the way of duty, if they be resolute and determined, are an
acceptable service; even the spark of goodness, if it glow with
sincerity in the bosom, is honoured and rewarded.</p>
<p>This is an animating consideration: we observe the effect
naturally produced in the mind of man, even by the approbation of
a fellow-creature, whom he regards as his superior; what holy
satisfaction then, and complacency and delight, may we not derive
from the persuasion, that our humble services are favourably
viewed by the all-wise and almighty God, who recompenses every
one according to his work: if God be pleased, whose displeasure
shall we fear?&nbsp; If &ldquo;God be for us, who shall be
against us?&rdquo;&nbsp; And O, that we may never forget, that it
is one of the great purposes of the gospel, to render us, infirm
and imperfect as we are, pleasing unto Him, through the merits
and intercession of our Redeemer; by &ldquo;walking worthy of the
vocation wherewith we are called.&rdquo; <a
name="citation262"></a><a href="#footnote262"
class="citation">[262]</a></p>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>3.&nbsp; The apostle proceeds, in the text, to open and
extend his view of evangelical righteousness.&nbsp; It consists
not in that partial cultivation of spiritual affections, in that
modified selection of particular duties, with which the christian
world is so prone to be content: it obliges the believer to
&ldquo;be fruitful unto every good work.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a
point, in which vast multitudes, in the christian church,
lamentably and notoriously fail; in which many fail, who make a
considerable profession of their zeal for religion; and comply,
to a certain degree, with most of its obligations.&nbsp; There
are some pleasures or pursuits, which, though they do not pretend
to reconcile them with the law of God, they still perseveringly
retain.&nbsp; Upon the whole, they professedly adopt the
ordinances and requisitions of the gospel: but there are some
more unpalatable than others; some to which they feel an
unconquered repugnance: and these they leave out of their
religious system altogether; to these they never so much as
resolve <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>to conform.&nbsp; And thus, they fail to manifest,
(what is confessedly the most difficult, yet the most important
of all christian attainments,) a surrender of the heart to
God.&nbsp; Their own inclination, their own judgment, and not the
divine will, is the rule and standard of their conduct; and no
doubt, if they felt this strong reluctance to the duties which
they do perform, these also would be equally neglected: in other
words, no part of their obedience rests upon a true foundation:
it proceeds not from a sincere belief in the truth and authority
of God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; All the injunctions, all the precepts
of the gospel are obligatory alike; all equally declarative of
the divine will, and equally necessary to the spiritual
renovation of man.&nbsp; And those injunctions and precepts, with
which we are the least disposed to comply, do in fact require our
peculiar attention and observance; because they point out to us
the natural blemishes, which stand most in need of repair;
because they shew where the greatest danger lies, of our <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>being
deficient in that complete change, of principle and affection and
character, which the infallible word of truth has declared to be
indispensable.</p>
<p>St. James assures us, that &ldquo;whosoever shall keep the
whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of
all:&rdquo; <a name="citation265"></a><a href="#footnote265"
class="citation">[265]</a> he who reserves to himself any
particular indulgence or pursuit, which is clearly at variance
with the will and word of God, obeys not, in any thing, from a
real christian motive; and shews himself ready, if a sufficient
temptation were offered, to disobey in any and every point.&nbsp;
It is true, that there is no &ldquo;good work,&rdquo; which the
Christian performs with uniform unvarying obedience; but neither
is there any, in which he does not sincerely desire and endeavour
&ldquo;to be fruitful;&rdquo; there is no act of righteousness,
to which he is a stranger; no &ldquo;besetting sin,&rdquo; which
he is unwilling or unmindful to cast away: though the good fruit,
to his sorrow, does too frequently fail, after all his
unqualified <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>labour; yet the unprofitable branch is pruned again,
and watered by the tears of repentance, and fructified with the
dews of heaven, and bears another day.&nbsp; He believes, and
fears, and &ldquo;loves the Lord his God with all his heart and
all his soul and all his strength;&rdquo; and therefore, though
there are many imperfections, there is no reserve in his
obedience.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The latter clause of the text directs us to a very
distinguishing feature in the christian character:
&ldquo;Increasing in the knowledge of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Knowledge
must evidently here be taken, in a larger sense, to signify a
lively comprehension of religious doctrines and duties, a
practical understanding of the will and ways of God.&nbsp; In
this knowledge it is absolutely essential that the true believer
should be continually advancing: the objects of his faith are of
such deep and overwhelming interest, that the longer they are
studied and pursued, the more they will, of necessity, captivate
his thoughts and strike root into his heart: the more he seeks
for the <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>treasures in God&rsquo;s word, the more he will find:
the more he knows of God, the more he will desire and delight to
know: feeling the comfort and happiness of a reconciliation with
his Maker, he is ever anxious to obtain a nearer and holier
communion with Him; sensible of his absolute and entire
dependence upon the Redeemer&rsquo;s mercy, he is ever leaning
upon Him with new satisfaction, with a growing spirit of
confidence and complacency; the more he thinks of heaven, the
more &ldquo;his affections are set on things above;&rdquo; the
more he thinks of the wretchedness of the rejected, the further
he flies, in terror, from their dreadful abode.&nbsp; The
consequence of all this must be, a progressive &ldquo;victory
over the world, the flesh, and the devil;&rdquo; a daily
improvement &ldquo;in all virtue and godliness of
living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there is yet another consideration; as we value and use
the gracious gifts of God, they are increased and multiplied unto
us; &ldquo;whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall
have more abundance;&rdquo; <a name="citation267"></a><a
href="#footnote267" class="citation">[267]</a> <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>the lamp
shines brighter, that is to guide his feet; and his heart is ever
quickened with fresh energy and zeal, by the influence of the
Holy Spirit; thus he goeth on from grace to grace, from strength
to strength, &ldquo;from glory to glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apostle, therefore, in praying that the converts might be
increasing in the knowledge of God, is praying that they might
have the invariable mark and earnest of a sincere and genuine
faith.&nbsp; How little does this point seem to be
considered!&nbsp; How many content themselves without any regular
advancement, without any advancement at all; they cannot, after
all the flattery with which they contrive to deceive themselves,
be persuaded in their minds, that they grow decidedly better as
they grow older: a year, perhaps many years ago, they were as
religious, as fruitful in piety and good works, as they are now:
no increase of spiritual knowledge, no new grace, no fresh habit
of obedience, no additional exertions to mark the lapse of time;
no passion subdued, <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>no unholy pursuit abandoned, no vice
mortified and forsaken.&nbsp; Wherever this is the case, the
gospel has not been sincerely received into the heart; it has not
been felt as the &ldquo;power of God unto salvation;&rdquo; it
has not been, as it is designed to be, an effectual instrument of
righteousness to the soul.&nbsp; To those, who remain in so
careless and indifferent and unimproving a condition, we must
say, that &ldquo;our preaching has been vain, and their faith is
also vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Possibly there may be some amongst us, who never yet bestowed
an adequate attention on this important point; if any such there
be, I would urgently exhort them, as they tender the salvation of
their souls, to neglect this point no longer; deeply to enquire
without delay, whether they &ldquo;are growing in grace, and in
the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.&rdquo; <a
name="citation269"></a><a href="#footnote269"
class="citation">[269]</a>&nbsp; Let them enter with earnestness
upon this necessary consideration; let it be frequently repeated:
Is my faith increased <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>and strengthened?&nbsp; Is my
character more holy, my conduct more upright?&nbsp; Does my
temper improve?&nbsp; Are my passions better regulated; my
thoughts more spiritual; my devotions more pure and fervent; my
affections more detached from the world, more fixed on God and
heaven?&nbsp; My life and conversation, are they more accordant
with the precepts and the example of my Saviour?</p>
<p>But the topics of enquiry are too numerous to be mentioned; I
will only add, that the sincere believer sets the &ldquo;prize of
his high calling&rdquo; continually before him; and advances to
it, in holiness and righteousness, every day; keeps advancing
till his race is run; and thus, when his toil is over, receives
the crown of victory, and &ldquo;enters into the joy of his
Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE WORD OF THE LORD PRECIOUS.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1 <span
class="smcap">Sam</span>. iii. 1.</p>
<p><i>The word of the Lord was precious in those days</i>;
<i>there was no open vision</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Moses to Samuel, a period of
several hundred years, there was no prophet regularly appointed;
particular revelations were made to individuals, and occasional
messages from heaven were publicly delivered to the people; but
there was no acknowledged prophet, to whom they might at all
times resort, to know the mind and will of God; or, as it is
described in the text, &ldquo;there was no open
vision.&rdquo;&nbsp; The natural consequence was, that such
intimations of the divine will, as were then given, made a deeper
impression; <a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>they were more highly valued and more eagerly sought
for, than when the gift of prophecy, in after ages, became more
common.&nbsp; When the word of God abounded, it was received with
indifference; when rarely vouchsafed, it was intently
desired.</p>
<p>Such is perpetually, and on all occasions, the perverseness of
man: blessings of every description are estimated, not according
to their excellence, but their rarity; not according to the ease,
but the difficulty, with which they are to be obtained.&nbsp; And
further, when in possession of a blessing, we are often utterly
insensible of its value; we abuse it in thoughtless excess, and
are ready to squander it away; but the moment it is departed, we
discover our blindness and folly; and would give, perhaps, all we
have, to bring the treasure back again.&nbsp; Meat and drink and
raiment, the air we breathe, the sun and the shower, excite no
spirit of gratitude, and by many are scarcely received and
remembered as blessings; but in the <a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>days of famine and of pestilence,
amidst the warfare and desolation of raging elements, these
benefits and mercies are painfully acknowledged, and ardently
desired.&nbsp; Again: the advantages of civil and religious
liberty make little impression upon the hearts of those, by whom
they are fully and uninterruptedly enjoyed: it is under the iron
arm of intolerance and oppression; it is in the dungeon and the
mine, that the excellency of these privileges is learned.&nbsp;
And thus it is of domestic happiness and comfort: the value of
home is frequently not appreciated, until it is forsaken and
lost; the worth of a friend, even of the nearest relative, is
sometimes but lightly considered, till he &ldquo;goes hence and
is no more seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These observations are also illustrative of the feelings and
conduct of men, in regard to their spiritual privileges and
blessings.&nbsp; While the light of divine revelation is shining
upon their dwellings, pointing out to them the way of salvation,
and opening the prospect of a glorious immortality, <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>they shut
their eyes, and turn away into the fatal paths of sin and misery,
to the darkness of eternal death; but when their opportunities
are lost, when &ldquo;the evil days are come upon them,&rdquo;
and there is no instructor or counsellor or comforter to be
found, they perceive the preciousness of the time and the
talents, which have been heedlessly thrown away; and would give
the world, if they possessed it, for what they were once
unwilling to make the smallest sacrifice.</p>
<p>We are apt to express a wonder at the obstinate indifference
of the people of Israel to their religious advantages and
instructions; we are astonished, that they could forget their
miraculous deliverances by the hand of Moses, and the manifold
revelations vouchsafed through him for their knowledge and
guidance; and that almost every divine communication to them, in
after ages, should have been but the forerunner of guilt and
apostacy: yet in truth, the history of Israel is but too faithful
a picture of the people of God in other <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>times and
other countries; by no means excluding our own.&nbsp; The word of
God has not been accounted precious, in proportion to the extent
to which it has been diffused; the Bible has not been, in too
many instances, the most highly prized, where it has been most
widely circulated; nor have the ministers of the gospel been
always most attentively and devoutly heard, where they have
increased and multiplied.&nbsp; Before the age of printing, when
the copies of the sacred word were comparatively few, the
Christian, who was so happy as to possess one, commonly regarded
it as a treasure; or if he could obtain a part only, by the
labours of the pen, even a gospel or an epistle, it was
considered as a &ldquo;pearl of great price.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
afterwards, in the days of ignorance and persecution, when the
sacred scriptures were withheld from the people by a blind and
bigotted priesthood, the thirst for divine knowledge, for these
streams of life and salvation, was inconceivably great; men
sought them and treasured them at <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>the peril of their lives.&nbsp; In
these dark days, and long after, the public preachers of the word
were few; and people flocked from distant quarters to hear the
good tidings proclaimed.&nbsp; Having no regular supply of
spiritual food, they sought it out with earnestness where they
might; &ldquo;the word of the Lord was precious in those
days;&rdquo; and &ldquo;beautiful upon the mountains were the
feet of Him,&rdquo; who came to &ldquo;lighten their
darkness,&rdquo; and to deliver the message of salvation to their
souls.</p>
<p>How widely different from this is the case in our day.&nbsp;
Copies of the Holy Scriptures are multiplied beyond all
calculation: not a village, scarcely a dwelling, where they are
not, or may not be procured: and, instead of any persecuting
power, forbidding the use of them, every possible encouragement
is afforded, and every means devised by which they may be
adequately understood.&nbsp; And such, under the divine blessing,
has been the success of those means, that the greater <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>portion,
even of the poorest in this favoured land, are able to discover
for themselves the light of life; to apply it for their guidance
and comfort and eternal salvation.</p>
<p>And with respect to the preaching of the gospel, though it is
not yet sufficient for the demand of our extended population,
still it may be truly described as general throughout the
land.&nbsp; Although, for &ldquo;the plenteous harvest, the
labourers are too few,&rdquo; still are they every where
abroad.&nbsp; And if it be objected, that &ldquo;the word of
truth is not always rightly divided,&rdquo; yet are there
portions of it uniformly read, in every christian assembly, on
the Lord&rsquo;s day; and in our own incomparable Liturgy, no
inconsiderable part of the divine word, of its saving doctrines
and duties, is actually embodied.</p>
<p>So much for our holy congratulation, for the honour and glory
of our land, for the rich abundance of spiritual privileges and
blessings, which, under the favour of almighty goodness, we have
the happiness <a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>to enjoy.&nbsp; It were well, if the sequel of our
subject afforded equal ground for rejoicing; that it equally
redounded to our honour.&nbsp; But here there is a dark cloud
resting, which casts over the scene a melancholy gloom.&nbsp; The
value set upon the word of God, its preciousness in the heart of
man, is not proportioned to the frequency and the fulness of its
communication.&nbsp; It is in almost every dwelling, but not in
every dwelling esteemed and loved; not devoutly treasured, not
eagerly and diligently read, as it used to be in the days of
scarcity.&nbsp; How many who possess it, perhaps superbly
ornamented, in a variety of forms, and with goodly
interpretations, seldom open it; seldom in comparison with its
high and everlasting importance, for their enlightenment and
edification: possibly it may be read on the Lord&rsquo;s day as a
cold customary exercise, and by vast numbers not even on the
Lord&rsquo;s day; they are positively unmindful of the sacred
treasure, unconscious that it is so much as in their <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>possession.&nbsp; No change of heart, no lively faith,
no spiritual strength is derived from its exalted doctrines; no
purification of the affections from its means of grace; no
regulation of the life and character from its perfect law of
righteousness.&nbsp; How should there be, when it is laid by,
idly, carelessly, and contemptuously.</p>
<p>The Bible is grievously neglected both by rich and poor.&nbsp;
The rich too seldom spare any of their abundant leisure, in
storing their minds with the riches of heavenly wisdom; other
books, of worldly interest or amusement, absorb almost their
whole attention; an unimproving, nay injurious publication, the
foolish dream of fiction, will be seized and read with avidity,
whilst the oracles of eternal truth are treated with an
indifference, that borders on disdain.&nbsp; The poor, it is
true, have but little leisure; sufficient however, if that little
were diligently used, to enable them to acquire a considerable
knowledge of their Bible; but the great multitude of them seek
their <a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>refreshment from other sources; from the pollutions of
earthly pleasure.&nbsp; We might have expected better things:
having fewer worldly possessions and comforts, it might be
thought, that the poor would gladly supply such deficiency by the
attainment of spiritual blessings; by raising their hopes and
affections to the imperishable treasures of a brighter world to
come: but it is too often found otherwise: the enjoyments of
earth, however unsatisfactory and even debasing, are preferred to
the abundant consolations and happiness of the gospel.</p>
<p>Thank God, there are many bright exceptions to these remarks,
both amongst the rich and the poor; the number is great, and we
hope increasing, of those to whom &ldquo;the word of the Lord has
been precious;&rdquo; who have &ldquo;received it with
gladness;&rdquo; who have &ldquo;believed with the heart unto
righteousness;&rdquo; who &ldquo;have seen the salvation of their
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; But still, when we cast our eyes upon the vast
and reckless multitude, we are ready to <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>weep over
it and to say, O that ye would know, even ye in this your day,
the things that belong unto your peace; before they be hid for
ever from your eyes.</p>
<p>From this lamentable neglect of the word of God, we may
readily account for the want of religious principle, for the
decay of religious character, for the overspreading of corruption
and vice, so notorious in the christian world.&nbsp; The
astonishing circulation of the Bible through this country, of
late years, might have reasonably led us to hope for a signal
diminution of irreligion and crime.&nbsp; And God forbid, we
should be of the number of those who maintain, that <i>no</i>
such advantage has been derived from this dissemination of the
word of life.&nbsp; But even the most sanguine person will not
contend, that this holy exertion, this spiritual culture has
produced a corresponding fruit: thousands of those, who have free
access to the Bible, are lying, if not in utter darkness, at
least in the shadow of death.&nbsp; And what is the cause?&nbsp;
The <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>scriptures are not valued in proportion to their
extended circulation; they are not read with humble reverential
attention, as the holy word of God; not understood or desired, as
the fountain of light and life; not sought as a means of
spiritual reformation and righteousness: and therefore, we may
expect a greater prevalence of iniquity; as a judgment of the
just and offended God, for so flagrant an abuse of the knowledge
of salvation.</p>
<p>And thus with regard to the preaching of His word: where is
that vehement desire, that deep interest, that holy concern to
profit withal, which was observable in the days when preachers
were few?&nbsp; We do not say, that it is utterly extinguished;
but certainly not proportioned to the opportunities
vouchsafed.&nbsp; How many in this our place and neighbourhood,
refuse to travel, even the shortest distance, to hear the gospel;
and of those who professedly go to hear it, not a few are led by
mere curiosity or custom.&nbsp; How do we stand condemned by many
a less <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>favoured people!&nbsp; There are indeed lands, at this
day, still thirsting for the knowledge of their God and Saviour;
lands, to which it has but just been carried, where it is only
beginning to be understood; and <i>there</i> the people will
instantly repair at the very sound of the good tidings, and wait
with eagerness upon the footsteps of the missionary, who bears in
his hand the sacred treasure; but <i>here</i>, where the
messengers are in every place, where the ministers of
reconciliation abound, here are awful numbers, who never enter
the house of God, for the single purpose of hearing His word: the
gift is continually offered, without trouble or risk,
&ldquo;without money or price;&rdquo; and, therefore, it would
seem, perversely despised.</p>
<p>Similar remarks may be made, concerning all those divine
ordinances and means of grace, with which this privileged land
has been so richly provided.&nbsp; The public worship of Almighty
God, the holy sacraments of our Church, the instruction afforded
to her children, the means of <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>private devotion and godly
advancement, all these are pressed upon the notice and acceptance
of all; it is not enough to say, that we are invited; we are
<i>urged</i> to the participation of these abundant blessings;
yet how often are we urged in vain.&nbsp; At this moment, in some
of our countries or dependencies abroad, where Churches are
sparingly scattered, and the visits of ministers are few and long
between, these divine ordinances are coveted with a painful
anxiety, and no opportunity is ever lost: here, in the mother
country, is the fountain of blessings, and the &ldquo;streams are
ever flowing withal;&rdquo; but thousands esteem not these waters
of life, and many never care to taste them.</p>
<p>It is impossible, that the truth of these observations can be
denied; and to every sincere and serious Christian the subject
must afford a painful reflection.&nbsp; And well does it become
us all, each in our several vocations, to exert our utmost power
for the abatement of so crying and alarming an evil.&nbsp; Many
of us, I trust, are <a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>gratefully sensible of the goodness
and love of God, in having so liberally bestowed upon our land
the blessings of the word of life; grateful from the experience
of its inestimable benefit to our own souls: let each then in his
station, and according to his influence and ability, recommend
the word to those around him; and assist in waking a slumbering
people to a sense of the glorious opportunities awaiting
them.&nbsp; Many, from their education and rank, have it in their
power to contribute largely to the success of this glorious
cause, to become instruments of righteousness and salvation to
their lost fellow-creatures: and the poorest may do much in this
blessed work; they may train their families in the study of the
Bible, may lead them to adore the God of mercy and of truth, and
to save their souls alive; considerable also is the impression,
which, by prudence and friendly care, they might make upon their
poor neighbours; bringing them to join together in happy union,
for the perusal of that word, which is their <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>common
interest and hope; which would elevate them above the troubles of
a stormy world, would lead them to &ldquo;lighten one
another&rsquo;s burdens,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;go on their way
together rejoicing.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, to say the least, every one
has the power to recommend the holy scriptures by the light of
his own example; by shewing, on all occasions, his love for the
Saviour&rsquo;s marvellous goodness; by duly reverencing and
reading the word of truth; and manifesting the blessedness
thereof, in the decided change of his own heart and temper, in
his own character and life.&nbsp; And all such recommendations,
let me add, the Lord is demanding at our hands, in return for His
unspeakable mercy.</p>
<p>My brethren, let us suppose, that it should please God, for
the heedlessness of this nation, to deprive us of the privilege
and blessing of the Bible; and to declare, that the neglected
ministry of His word should be continued no longer: we should
undoubtedly regard this as the direst calamity, which could
possibly befal us; <a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>we should immediately and cheerfully consent to any
sacrifice, by which so dreadful a token of divine wrath might be
averted.&nbsp; Then let us be consistent; and whilst we do enjoy
this invaluable favour of heaven, let it be cherished and
improved.&nbsp; Let the gospel, instead of being less precious to
us, on account of its universal publication, and its facility of
attainment, be therefore prized the more; and while we adore the
Lord of mercy for diffusing this heavenly benefit through our
dear and native land, let the treasure be laid up in our own
bosom: what is intended for the good of all, is intended for the
good of each: to bless God for giving the gospel to our country,
and to undervalue or neglect it ourselves, is folly and
hypocrisy; but too many individuals, amounting indeed to a large
portion of our christian community, are guilty of this folly, and
thus exposing the land to judgment, thus endangering &ldquo;the
ark of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of <i>us</i>, my brethren, do I trust feel <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>thankful to
our God and Saviour, who hath honoured us, unworthy as we are,
with the revelation of His word, and hath &ldquo;brought life and
immortality to light:&rdquo; whatever others then may do, let our
sense of the gracious gift be undeniably and duly shewn: let us
daily have recourse to this holy word, as &ldquo;the lamp of our
feet and the light of our paths:&rdquo; be it our constant prayer
for the spirit of God to open our eyes that we may understand,
and our hearts that we may reverence, the wonders of His holy
law; that it may be the object and study of our lives, to walk in
all those means of grace, which it holds forth for our redemption
from sin and death; for our safe passage through this transitory
world of trial, to an eternal world of happiness and glory beyond
the grave.&nbsp; If we hear and read and mark and learn, in the
spirit of devotion and prayer, we shall continually find new
treasures of mercy opening to our view; new and unlooked-for
stores of knowledge; new affections and dispositions; new hopes
and prospects, <a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>in the promises of the blessed Jesus: the word will be
a blessing to us through life and even to our journey&rsquo;s
end; a sure guide amid the dangers of prosperity, a powerful
support in the day of trouble, an inconceivable comfort when we
die.&nbsp; But if we prize it not in life, how can we expect
consolation from it in death?&nbsp; On the contrary, our spirits
will be weighed down by the grievous remembrance of inexcusable
neglect.&nbsp; Be wise in time; lay up in store the good
foundation: the word, having been all along precious, will be
increasing in value to the last; even until it leads us to the
&ldquo;open vision&rdquo; of eternal day.</p>
<h2><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>SERMON XVI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">DISTINCTIONS TO BE MADE ON THE DAY OF
JUDGMENT.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Matt</span>. xxiv. 40.</p>
<p><i>The one shall be taken and the other left</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the chapter before us, our
blessed Lord is describing to His disciples various
circumstances, which should attend the destruction of Jerusalem;
an event, which has been generally regarded by the christian
Church, as representative of the proceedings of that more awful
day, when Christ shall appear at last to judge the universal
world, &ldquo;in righteousness and truth;&rdquo; and
&ldquo;render unto every man according unto his works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many false teachers had arisen, even in those early days of
the gospel, pretending to set forth the signs of Christ&rsquo;s
<a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>coming
to take vengeance on His enemies; and therefore the disciples had
requested of their Master some certain information on this
momentous topic: they &ldquo;came unto Him privately, saying,
Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign
of Thy coming and of the end of the world?&nbsp; And Jesus
answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you:
For many shall come in My name, saying, I am Christ, and shall
deceive many.&nbsp; And ye shall hear of wars, and rumours of
wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come
to pass, but the end is not yet.&nbsp; For nation shall rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be
famines and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.&nbsp;
All these are the beginning of sorrows.&rdquo; <a
name="citation291"></a><a href="#footnote291"
class="citation">[291]</a></p>
<p>Our Lord proceeds to detail a great variety of other
circumstances which should occur, some of them belonging to <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>the
desolations of Judea, some to the future judgment alone, and some
to both these events; of which latter kind is the description
connected with the text: &ldquo;There shall be two in the field;
the one shall be taken and the other left.&nbsp; Two women shall
be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken and the other
left:&rdquo; that is, though destruction shall fall upon the
Jewish nation at large, for their rebellion against God, their
resistance to the clear evidence of the gospel, their shedding of
the blood of His beloved Son, yet shall not all be equally
involved in the same calamity and perdition.&nbsp; Divine
providence will then make a distinction between those, who have
obstinately rejected and maliciously persecuted the Saviour and
His holy religion, and those, whose hearts have been opened to
the reception &ldquo;of the truth as it is in Jesus;&rdquo; who,
being convinced and converted, have become His faithful
followers.</p>
<p>And though the whole race be so intermingled, one amongst
another, by the <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>various offices and duties and relations of life, that
to the eye of man there may be no distinguishable difference
amongst them; yet the all-seeing God, who &ldquo;is a discerner
of the thoughts of the heart,&rdquo; will not be misguided by any
outward appearances; will perceive a very manifest difference in
characters seemingly alike: will infallibly know whom to punish
and whom to spare.&nbsp; As in the overthrow of Sodom and
Gomorrah, He singled out, and selected for preservation, one
righteous person, (and for his sake, a portion of his family
also,) so, in the storm of vengeance about to fall upon the
devoted city of Jerusalem, He would, in many signal instances,
make the same merciful distinction.&nbsp; And the declaration,
thus made, was calculated at once to comfort and encourage the
faithful, and to alarm the conscience and check the presumption
of the wicked.</p>
<p>The intimation here afforded of the perfect knowledge and the
just discrimination of the Almighty, in regard to His judgments
<a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>upon the
Jewish people, applies with peculiar force and truth to His
perfect dealings with all mankind, at the last great day.&nbsp;
Although, when Jerusalem was destroyed, it is undoubtedly true,
that the faithful disciples of Jesus were generally delivered,
yet it cannot be supposed that, in so extensive an overthrow, all
the Christians, and all their innocent children, without any
exception escaped.&nbsp; But when Christ shall sit upon His
throne of judgment, not one undeserved victim shall there be; and
not one, who &ldquo;has sinned against the light,&rdquo; shall
escape with impunity.&nbsp; All those inequalities, which are
unavoidable in the present constitution of things, shall then be
made right and recompensed.&nbsp; The murdered innocent shall be
requited with a robe of glory; and the prosperous sinner be
abased with scorn and infamy.</p>
<p>How necessary, how indispensable, for the assertion and
execution of divine justice, is the appointment of such a
tribunal!&nbsp; How unequally are deserts distributed in <a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>this
probationary world!&mdash;very often in cases, of which we
ourselves may form an adequate opinion.&nbsp; Not unfrequently do
we observe the righteous, doomed to extreme poverty and
affliction and suffering; and though they be most graciously
comforted and supported under their several burdens, we can
hardly imagine, that such alleviation is all the requital they
are to receive: and in truth, what is the principal source of
their comfort and support?&nbsp; Is it not the hope of a happy
termination?&nbsp; Is it not the prospect of entering into an
everlasting rest, of being for ever delivered from sorrow and
pain, in the presence of their Saviour and their God?&nbsp; And
can we believe, that this blessed expectation, vouchsafed as the
solace of their woes, will end in disappointment and
nothingness?&nbsp; Does it not point to a day, in which their
bright hopes will be more than realized in the merciful sentence
of their Judge; in their reception, at His hands and through His
merits, of &ldquo;an eternal recompense of reward?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>And
thus, on the contrary, frequently do we see the unprincipled and
the profligate enjoying the favour of the world, and rising to no
inconsiderable eminence of earthly prosperity: their crosses and
vexations and troubles no doubt they have, as the natural fruit
of irreligion and vice; as the retributive chastisement of an
offended God; &ldquo;sowing in corruption,&rdquo; they do
certainly more or less reap in sorrow; but still, if there were
no other state, their lot would be, comparatively at least, much
happier than they deserve; and therefore <i>their</i> condition
also leads us to expect, and fearfully does it betoken, a day of
fuller retribution; when the infinite justice and truth of God
will be finally and perfectly vindicated.</p>
<p>Many cases, like these, of suffering virtue and prosperous
vice, we are able clearly to discern: so broad are the lines, so
prominent the features, that we can scarcely be mistaken: but
perhaps there are many more cases, of which we can form no
adequate opinion at all; neither <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>in any instance, could we pretend to
award or ascertain the exact degree of merit due to any
individual.&nbsp; When we speak of merit, we do not mean to
intimate that any action, in itself, is deserving of reward; we
regard works of righteousness, only as the fruit of faith in a
crucified Redeemer.&nbsp; But this fruit is much more abundant,
and much more excellent, in some than others; and sometimes, when
it makes the fairest shew, the quality is inferior.&nbsp; By
merit then, we here mean the faith and behaviour of a Christian;
or, that behaviour by which the faith is manifested; that, to
which God has freely promised a reward, for the sake of our great
Redeemer.&nbsp; According to the faith, will the fruit be, both
in quality and abundance; and according to the fruit will be the
gracious reward; which reward He alone can determine and bestow,
who discovers the secret springs of the character and conduct of
every man living.</p>
<p>The value of an action depends upon the spirit and principle,
with which it is <a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>performed; and of these things no one can perfectly
judge, but the searcher of the heart.&nbsp; Even in the christian
community, many words and deeds there are, obtaining applause
from men, which will be condemned by the omniscient God, as
having proceeded from unworthy motives, and being but the garb of
hypocrisy; many persons there are, in whose respective demeanour
we may be able to trace no very marked lines of difference, who
yet differ most essentially, when measured by the scale of
infinite truth and justice: all these secret distinctions will be
clearly brought to light at the great inquiry on the
judgment-day; every one will then appear in his true character;
the veil of deception will be for ever torn aside; and of those,
who seem alike to us in the present life, we shall find that one
will be taken and another left; one taken to glory, and another
left to shame and wretchedness and ruin.</p>
<p>It may be useful to mention a few instances, in which we may
be deceived <a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>in our comparative estimate of men.&nbsp; Even with
regard to the fundamental principles of religion, to a real
belief in the truths of the Bible, to the essentials of a
christian character, it is possible that we may form very
mistaken opinions concerning many around us.&nbsp; It is true,
that insincerity and deceit are commonly, sooner or later, in
some degree detected; it is difficult to be always dissimulating,
and acting a part; some evil fruit, some inconsistency does
generally betray the hollowness of hypocritical pretensions:
still however, it is not always so; and doubtless there are
some,&mdash;out of the number of those persons, whom we are in
the habit of considering as equally resting their hopes upon the
true foundation, equally believing in Jesus Christ for pardon and
salvation, equally zealous in the maintenance of His holy
religion and attentive to the ordinances,&mdash;some there are,
who differ materially from others, in the unerring judgment of
God.&nbsp; They may repair to the same place of worship, perhaps
<a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>with the
same degree of regularity, but with very different views and
impressions: we can judge only of the outward appearance, of the
posture of the body or the moving of the lips; it is for the Lord
to look upon the posture of the soul and the offering of the
heart.&nbsp; Many, no question, come to the House of God from
very unworthy motives and for very unworthy purposes; and
frequently they do not escape the observance of <i>man</i>; but
<i>man</i> cannot penetrate into the case of every individual; to
the eye of Jehovah alone are &ldquo;all things naked and
open;&rdquo; He sees and judges, <i>who</i> come unto Him in
humble faith; who approach His tabernacle is a pious frame and
temper, with holy affections, with integrity of heart; who
&ldquo;worship Him in spirit and in truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; My
brethren, it is an awful consideration: but from the same Church,
the same christian society, the same assembly of worshippers,
&ldquo;one shall be taken and another left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, with respect to a discharge of <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>the
ordinary duties of life, there may be much real, though little
seeming difference, in the characters of many, with whom we are
daily acquainted.&nbsp; Punctuality and diligence, though always
commendable and useful for the public good, may be, in as far as
the person himself is concerned, of little value in the sight of
God; our acceptableness with God, in this matter, depends upon
the principle and the view and the spirit, with which the
business of life is conducted: it may be carried on merely for
the sake of self-interest; of gain, reputation, and pleasure;
without any religious feeling or purpose whatever, without a
single prayer offered up for heavenly assistance and blessing,
without a word of thanksgiving or acknowledgment: or, on the
other hand, we may proceed to our daily employments and pursuits,
&ldquo;strong in the Lord and in the power of His might;&rdquo;
imploring and depending upon His grace; &ldquo;doing whatever we
do for His glory;&rdquo; active and diligent and faithful, from a
sense of love and duty <a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>to Him, for the sake of obeying the
law of our blessed Redeemer, and thus bringing forth the fruit of
faith unto perfection; &ldquo;living soberly, righteously and
godly in this <i>present</i> world,&rdquo; <a
name="citation302a"></a><a href="#footnote302a"
class="citation">[302a]</a> with the continual hope and
expectation of a glorious world to come.&nbsp; Now, whether
industry be the work of religious principle, or whether it arise
merely from selfish and earthly views, <i>we</i> are often unable
to decide: but God knoweth all the thoughts of man; and therefore
can assign, to every action and habit and pursuit, its true
origin and its due reward; and many persons, it will be found at
last, who have gone forth together unto their labour, who have
been engaged in the same occupations, have toiled together as
companions in life, will be separated when the day of full
inquiry comes; the one, having &ldquo;sown unto the
spirit,&rdquo; shall be <i>taken</i> to enjoy the fruit of life
everlasting; the other, having &ldquo;sown unto the flesh,&rdquo;
shall be <i>left</i> to &ldquo;reap corruption.&rdquo; <a
name="citation302b"></a><a href="#footnote302b"
class="citation">[302b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>Similar observations will of course hold good, with
regard to the practice of particular virtues.&nbsp; They,
&ldquo;who give alms only to be seen of men;&rdquo; who dispense
their bounty from any other principle, than that of love to their
Saviour; for any other purpose, than to serve God and to benefit
their fellow-creatures; they &ldquo;<i>have</i> their
reward&rdquo; already&mdash;the only reward, which they are
caring to seek&mdash;the applause, the good will, or the esteem
of mankind: and they must not expect, on the latter day, the
reward which they seek not; the approval of their sovereign Lord;
the praises and blessings of christian charity.&nbsp; Again, they
who exercise the virtues of honesty or sobriety, merely for the
sake of worldly expedience or reputation, will likewise
&ldquo;have their reward&rdquo; all the reward they are to
expect, in this life.&nbsp; Christian faith and christian
principle are the only foundations, upon which a Christian can
surely and successfully build; they, who build upon them, will be
taken to see the goodly fabric perfected in <a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>heaven;
whilst every work, which is raised upon &ldquo;other
foundation,&rdquo; will be left to desolation and devouring
fire.</p>
<p>And even they, who have communed together, through their
earthly pilgrimage, in the bonds of familiar intimacy; who have
been united all their lives long, by the nearest and dearest ties
of kindred; even they will be subject to the same discriminating
judgment at the last.&nbsp; If they have been bound together in
the holy bonds of the gospel, as well as of family affection; if
they have been faithful brethren in the Lord, as well as in the
flesh, &ldquo;walking with God as friends,&rdquo; it will be
well; then, as they &ldquo;were lovely and pleasant in their
lives, in their deaths they shall not be divided:&rdquo; <a
name="citation304"></a><a href="#footnote304"
class="citation">[304]</a> together shall they go to heaven, and
be admitted to enjoy a more delightful communion with each other,
in the happy paradise above.&nbsp; But if it be otherwise, if
such friends be of opposite characters; the one
&ldquo;carnally&rdquo; the other &ldquo;spiritually
minded;&rdquo; <a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>then, their ends must be opposite also;
&ldquo;death&rdquo; is the portion of one, &ldquo;life and
peace&rdquo; <a name="citation305a"></a><a href="#footnote305a"
class="citation">[305a]</a> of the other: their union therefore
must be dissolved.&nbsp; The world may regard all the members of
a family, as nearly alike in character; but the difference may
nevertheless be great; and the distinction, in another world,
will be great also.&nbsp; The wicked parent shall see its
innocent offspring no more; the pious father shall not deliver
the undutiful child, nor the obedient child its rebellious
father; <a name="citation305b"></a><a href="#footnote305b"
class="citation">[305b]</a> each can save but his own soul.&nbsp;
How feelingly and powerfully does this consideration appeal to
christian families; admonishing them, to regard not the present
only, but the everlasting welfare of each other; to &ldquo;edify
one another&rdquo; in holiness and godly love; lest, after they
have been so intimately connected together upon earth, while the
one is taken to felicity and glory, the other be left to
&ldquo;mourning, lamentation and woe.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>How
are christian parents bound, to watch over the offspring they so
tenderly love!&nbsp; Watch they do, with continual anxiety, for
the temporal benefit of their children, for all that can minister
to their comfort and honour and advancement in life: they rejoice
in the joy of their children, and weep when their children weep:
but O how infinitely more important is the provision for
eternity: earthly ties will soon be broken; how important, that
we should provide for a happy renewal of intercourse and love
hereafter!&nbsp; Parting now, to meet no more, were enough to
break the heart; but the bright prospect of a re-union in
paradise consoles and reconciles; forbidding us &ldquo;to sorrow
as those who have no hope.&rdquo;&nbsp; See then, ye christian
parents, to the nurture and training of the &ldquo;olive branches
round about your table;&rdquo; bestow, upon their spiritual
well-being, an especial and exceeding care; that ye may behold
them &ldquo;flourishing in the house of the Lord&rdquo; above:
that, whether ye be taken from <a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>them, or they from you, there may be
comfort in the parting.&nbsp; See, all christian relatives and
friends, by whatever name ye are endeared; see that ye live not
in worldly, but heavenly affection: instructing, admonishing,
animating one another in the profession of the true faith and the
exercise of all godliness; that so your converse and communion
may never be embittered by the fear of eternal separation.</p>
<p>Lastly, let the truth, here declared by the infallible word of
God, check the presumption of the careless and the wicked; and
give comfort and encouragement to the faithful.&nbsp; The
worldling may fancy, because no great distinction, between him
and others, is made upon earth; because he perhaps can see no
great reason for such distinction; that, therefore, he shall
escape in the end; but in the day when &ldquo;God will judge the
secrets of men by Jesus Christ,&rdquo; <a
name="citation307"></a><a href="#footnote307"
class="citation">[307]</a> when &ldquo;every one shall receive
the things done in his body, according <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>to that he
hath done, whether it be good or bad,&rdquo; <a
name="citation308"></a><a href="#footnote308"
class="citation">[308]</a> he will find, that an immeasurable
distinction will be made between him &ldquo;that hath served God,
and him that hath served him not;&rdquo; between him, whose heart
has been given to his Creator and Redeemer, and sanctified by the
Spirit of grace, and him, who has only made it his object to
maintain a decent appearance in the world.&nbsp; If we do believe
in the final judgment, if we believe in the perfect truth and
justice of the Almighty, we must conclude, that this fearful
difference will be made.&nbsp; And if it were so dreadful a
calamity, to be left to fall in the tremendous overthrow of
Jerusalem, what will it be, to be left an everlasting-prey to the
tortures of Satan and of sin?</p>
<p>But let the true believer, the righteous servant of God in
Jesus Christ, take encouragement and comfort: there is no
exercise of faith, no holy meditation, no fervent prayer, no
religious deed, no pious intention or design, however secret from
<a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>the eyes
of men, which can escape the notice of their heavenly Father:
though justice is not, cannot be, done to their characters here;
though sometimes the greatest injustice and injury and wrong; yet
shall they be triumphantly and gloriously vindicated at the last:
though they be on earth forsaken or oppressed, though they bear
the burden of private affliction or public scorn, in a
&ldquo;world which is not worthy of them,&rdquo; they shall be
visited and acknowledged and received at the last; shall lift up
their heads with honour and with joy, and be admitted into a
kingdom, which is more than worthy of all their faith and all
their constancy; the Redeemer has marked them for His own; He
will single them out, on the last day, from the crowd of
countless multitudes, as objects of his compassion and favour;
will take them into the arms of His mercy, and so &ldquo;they
shall be forever with the Lord.&rdquo; <a

<span class="GutSmall">GOD MADE MAN UPRIGHT; MAN MAKES HIMSELF
MISERABLE.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Eccles</span>. vii. 29.</p>
<p><i>Lo</i>, <i>this only have I found</i>, <i>that God hath
made man upright</i>, <i>but they have sought out many
inventions</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this remarkable book, Solomon
discusses the various earthly means employed by the human race,
for the attainment of happiness; and he decides upon the utter
insufficiency of them all.&nbsp; Nor is he to be regarded as
making the enquiry from mere matter of speculation, but as
declaring to the world the result of his own experience, as well
as the counsels of the Most High.&nbsp; Exalted to the very
summit of worldly prosperity and greatness, and <a
name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>learned in
all the arts and sciences, he possessed advantages, in the
pursuit of happiness, far beyond the common lot of mortality; if
it were to be found upon earth, he would have been sure, in
himself or some of his favoured dependents, to have made the
discovery.&nbsp; But he declares, by many remarkable repetitions,
his utter inability so to do; he gives up the matter as hopeless
and impossible; &ldquo;all, (even the fairest and the best of
human schemes,) is vanity and vexation of spirit;&rdquo;
&ldquo;that which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that
which is wanting cannot be numbered.&rdquo; <a
name="citation311"></a><a href="#footnote311"
class="citation">[311]</a></p>
<p>And this conclusion corresponds with the experience of mankind
in every age: happiness has always been their object;
philosophers have laid down rules for its acquirement, and every
variety of expedient has been tried; but all in vain; there is no
permanent pleasure or satisfaction upon earth: independently of
the crosses and vexations from without, by <a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>which it is
so continually disturbed, there is something in the constitution
of man, in the present state of his mind and heart and
affections, by which the attainment of happiness, from temporal
means alone, is positively forbidden.</p>
<p>The royal preacher, thus convinced of this truth, turns his
thoughts to a solution of the case, and sums up his observations,
on the conduct and condition of man, in the words of the
text.&nbsp; Instead of arraigning, like some bold and impious
cavillers of our day, the wisdom or goodness of the Creator in
the introduction of evil into the world, he gives the true
account of the matter; and lays the blame where alone it is due,
upon the disobedience and degeneracy of man.&nbsp; And in so
doing, he bears testimony to the truth of one of the most
important communications made to us in the revealed word of
God&mdash;the original innocence and the fall of our first
parents.&nbsp; This fact has been daringly called in question by
certain professed believers of divine revelation, by some who
boast themselves <a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>peculiarly entitled to the christian name.&nbsp;
Anxious to exalt the moral excellency of human nature, and to
disprove the doctrine and necessity of the atonement, through the
prevailing efficacy of the Saviour&rsquo;s incarnation and
sufferings, such vain disputers absolutely deny, in the very face
of God&rsquo;s word, that any such total and dreadful change has
ever taken place in the state of mankind; they contend, that our
understandings and affections are now the same, as when we came
originally from the hands of our Creator.&nbsp; It appears,
however, that the <i>wisest</i> of men took a different view of
this momentous subject; that he received the Mosaic account,
recorded in the opening of the book of Genesis, according to its
plain and natural interpretation; and he has delivered to us his
judgment, by the inspiration of that Holy Spirit, under whose
guidance it was impossible for him to err.</p>
<p>Solomon introduces his declaration upon this point in a very
awakening manner; in a manner frequent with the inspired <a
name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>writers,
when about to deliver a sentence of peculiar weight and
importance; &ldquo;Lo, this only have I found;&rdquo; behold,
attend to this truth; this is the result of my observations, this
the &ldquo;conclusion of the whole matter,&rdquo; this the
explanation of all the evil and unhappiness in the world, that
&ldquo;God hath made man upright, but they have sought out many
inventions;&rdquo; that man was created innocent by the wise and
merciful Author of his being; formed for pure unalloyed
enjoyment; and the marring and misery, which he experiences, are
solely attributable to the change induced by his own apostacy and
rebellion; to his seeking out ways and means of happiness,
contrary to the will and appointment of his Creator.&nbsp;
&ldquo;God saw every thing that He had made, and behold, it was
very good;&rdquo; <a name="citation314"></a><a
href="#footnote314" class="citation">[314]</a> and man, the lord
of creation, was not less fitted than the objects around him, to
answer the good and gracious purposes of heaven.&nbsp; So God
&ldquo;created man in His own image; <a name="page315"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 315</span>in the image of God created He him;
male and female created He them;&rdquo; <a
name="citation315"></a><a href="#footnote315"
class="citation">[315]</a> in the image of holiness, and
therefore happy.</p>
<p>How far man has fallen from this state of uprightness, is a
question which has caused much difference and contention in the
christian world; some persons, from a desire of exalting the free
grace of God, declare that the divine image in man was totally
corrupted and lost by the fall; that there remains, in his
unregenerate nature, no spirit or particle of excellency, no
perception of what is good; that his nature is a mere chaos of
disorder, a mass of decay, which is altogether incapable of
producing any thing but &ldquo;confusion and every evil
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the other hand, it is contended, that the
wreck of man&rsquo;s nature was but partial; that there remains a
considerable disposition to practice, as well as approve,
&ldquo;whatsoever things are pure and honest and lovely and of
good report;&rdquo; that man is still able, by his own judgment
and strength, in many <a name="page316"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 316</span>things to please God and to serve
Him.&nbsp; It does not fall within our purpose, on the present
occasion, to attempt any accurate adjustment of this difference;
but we may observe, that it is dangerous to insist upon either
extreme.&nbsp; A belief, that man can will or do nothing, is apt
to lead to a persuasion that he has nothing to will or do; that
his salvation is a work totally independent of himself; a measure
of grace absolutely forced upon him: and a belief, is that man
able of himself to &ldquo;refuse the evil and to choose the
good,&rdquo; that he &ldquo;knows how to walk and to please
God,&rdquo; creates a spirit of self-righteousness, at once
destructive of the sinner&rsquo;s hope; preventing his dependence
upon the all-sufficiency of God, and subversive of the truth of
the gospel.</p>
<p>A faculty of discernment between good and evil, for the moral
government of man, is evidently vouchsafed to his unrenewed
nature; and a power, in dependence upon the divine teaching, to
accept or reject the proposals of mercy and grace, does surely
remain to us, or else the numberless <a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>exhortations of God to the sinner
appear to be of no benefit and no meaning: and who can reasonably
suppose, that sinners would have been so frequently and severely
condemned, for refusing that grace, which they were positively
incapable of accepting.&nbsp; The language of our ninth Article
on this point appears to be most temperate and unobjectionable:
&ldquo;Man is very <i>far gone</i> from original righteousness,
and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh
lusteth always contrary to the spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; With this
statement we may rest content.</p>
<p>One of the many bitter fruits of the fall is, that man no
longer seeks his happiness in God, where alone it can be found,
but in ways of his own devising, in the crooked ways opened to
his view and imagination by the destructive enemy of his soul; no
longer in innocence and holiness and obedience, but in vicious
inclinations and pursuits, &ldquo;in the lust of the flesh and
the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life;&rdquo; <a
name="citation317"></a><a href="#footnote317"
class="citation">[317]</a> <a name="page318"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>in those very principles and means,
which brought &ldquo;death into the world and all our woe:&rdquo;
it is no wonder, therefore, that happiness, from a search like
this, should not be found.&nbsp; They, who search in this manner,
are like the wicked spirit, &ldquo;walking through dry places,
seeking rest and finding none;&rdquo; like the dove of Noah, in
the overwhelming of the waters, roving about on weary wing, and
finding no resting place for the sole of her foot.&nbsp; Nor is
it possible for man to be blessed again with perfect peace, peace
without any interruption or alloy, until he be altogether
restored to &ldquo;the image of Him that created him:&rdquo; the
nearer he approaches to that restoration, the more he will
assuredly possess of true satisfaction and delight; but the
blessing can never be complete, till the original defilement be
utterly purged away, till his understanding is enlarged for a
full knowledge of the good and great and glorious Creator; till
he can be brought to love and serve Him without any mixture of
infirmity; till he returns not only to <a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>His favour,
but into His immediate presence, in the second Eden, of eternal
bliss.</p>
<p>Still may man enjoy, even upon earth, no inconsiderable degree
of peace and happiness.&nbsp; The promises and blessings of the
gospel impart a &ldquo;joy and gladness&rdquo; to the believer,
and fill him with comfort, which the world can neither give nor
take away: the avoiding and abhorring of evil will prevent those
painful reflections, which inhabit the mind of the reckless
sinner: the life of faith in a merciful Saviour, the worship and
service of God, the works of piety and love, the walk of
uprightness and integrity, though accompanied with imperfections,
and, therefore, with abatements of comfort, yet do infallibly
produce a great tranquillity of soul, and unspeakable emotions of
holy joy; the sincere Christian contemplates his present
condition with happy, though humble persuasion of acceptance with
his God; and looks forward with an animated exulting hope of the
perfect consummation <a name="page320"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 320</span>of his felicity, in another and a
better world.&nbsp; The trials and troubles of this life do
indeed still continue; yet they have no power to harm, and
therefore none to distress him; he &ldquo;casts his burden upon
the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in the natural, unrenewed, unconverted
world, there is no such redeeming principle, no qualification of
evil, no pure sources of delight: let the votaries of earthly
enjoyment seek it with what ardour and devotedness they may, it
is a phantom which is ever eluding their grasp; flitting before
their eyes in the shape of promises and visions, but never in
substantial possession.</p>
<p>It is indeed sadly instructive, to consider the numberless
devices to which men are driven, in their search after happiness,
when once they have forsaken the faith and fear of God; how busy
they are in the invention of new scenes and pursuits; quitting
one after another, as each deceives and fails; how they are
wearing and wasting away the little span of life, in vain
experiment and profitless enquiry.&nbsp; <a
name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>How are the
opulent contriving their multiplied means and opportunities of
enjoyment, with all their splendour of establishment, and a train
of dependents obedient to their will!&nbsp; And if we could form
a judgment by outward appearances, we might be inclined to
pronounce them happy: but under this beautiful veil, with all
this pomp of circumstance, many a corroding care, many a
mortified desire, many a bitter disappointment, lie constantly
concealed.</p>
<p>To envy the rich, as if they were the certain possessors of
comfort and ease, is one of the greatest of all mistakes and
follies; happiness must dwell in the mind and the heart; it must
depend altogether upon the state of mind and heart; it is not to
be purchased with money; money, we must grant, may be made to
minister to it, but this must entirely depend upon the
disposition, the spirit, the manner, in which it is used: the
smallest pittance upon earth, possessed in the faith of the
gospel, in the fear and love of God, produces <a
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>infinitely
more enjoyment, than the countless treasures of those, who seek
or spend or save them, with a view to themselves and this world
alone.</p>
<p>Some are revelling in the dreams of ambition; and imagine,
that if they could attain a particular eminence, they should be
happy: but the road is steep and slippery, toilsome and
dangerous; and the summit, if ever they reach it, is not a land
of repose, not the habitation of contentment and peace;
&ldquo;seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them
not.&rdquo; <a name="citation322"></a><a href="#footnote322"
class="citation">[322]</a>&nbsp; Ambition is always dissatisfied;
if not the most unclean, it is one of the most tormenting spirits
in the bosom of man; and yet it is fondly and generally cherished
both by rich and poor.&nbsp; Be humble; be moderate; be content;
if thou wouldest be happy.</p>
<p>In what are called the pleasurable scenes of life, it is
unnecessary for me further to insist, how vainly we rove in quest
of substantial delight: this indeed is a <a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>truth still
more level to the experience of us all; it is a path we have
often trodden, but never I think with satisfaction.&nbsp; Witness
the continual changing, the endless variety of amusements, which
are found necessary in order to relieve satiety and disgust,
necessary even when they are innocent; and in sinful pleasures,
in lust and intemperance of every kind, it is needless to tell
you, there can be no peace; health is impaired and the conscience
is burdened; they are like a two-edged sword, cutting on both
sides, destroying both body and soul.</p>
<p>The force of these arguments may be made to appear from
another consideration; for whatever delusions may be practised
upon men, to induce them to reckon and build upon earth alone; to
trust for happiness to their own inventions, to human schemes and
devices; yet will they never, in their serious moments, contend
for the wisdom of their choice; or say, that their expectations
have been answered; they will never, when they <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>come to
die, recommend to their friends, assembled round their bed, the
course which they pursued, as a sure foundation of comfort in
their lives, and peace in their latter end; the dying father will
not recommend it to his children, nor the dying brother to his
brethren.&nbsp; No: it will then be seen, either by the tears of
bitter remorse or the agonies of unrepented guilt, that the way
of the world was &ldquo;the broad way that leadeth unto
destruction;&rdquo; that the soul can never find rest, till it
returns to the forsaken paths of righteousness, to the lost image
of its God.</p>
<p>And thanks to the unspeakable mercy of God in Christ Jesus,
the way of recovery is abundantly made known; the kingdom of
heaven, with all its joys and treasures, is opened to every
believer.&nbsp; Wisdom has come down from above, to tabernacle
with sinful man; to lighten his darkness, and to rejoice his
soul; and &ldquo;<i>her</i> ways are ways of pleasantness, and
all her paths are peace&rdquo;&mdash;pleasantness and peace to
those, who seek them with <a name="page325"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>their whole heart, implicitly and
devotedly, as manifested in the gracious revelation of their
God.</p>
<p>But unhappily, in the way of religion also, in their professed
walk of faith, men will be seeking out many inventions of their
own, instead of submitting themselves, with simplicity and godly
sincerity, to the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; They are seeking
to accommodate His divine law to their corrupt inclinations and
indulgences, to the maxims and fashions and interests of an
ensnaring world: and thus they fail of the happiness, which they
were led to expect.&nbsp; No wonder, that they find not the
christian promises realised; that they fall short of the comfort,
as they do of the obedience of faith.&nbsp; To the believing in
our crucified Lord, with all the heart and soul; to &ldquo;the
seeking first His kingdom and His righteousness;&rdquo; to the
&ldquo;forsaking all and following Him;&rdquo; to &ldquo;the
spirit of God dwelling in us, and mortifying the deeds of the
body;&rdquo; to the sincere desire after holiness &ldquo;as He <a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>is
holy;&rdquo; to &ldquo;the fulfilling of the law of
righteousness;&rdquo; to a living hope of &ldquo;the inheritance
that fadeth not away&rdquo;&mdash;to these things, the promise of
life is made; of joy and favour here, and eternal felicity
hereafter; but if we, in dependence upon our own vain inventions,
seek to be blessed in any other way; with a less entire belief,
and a less holy profession, and a less devoted obedience, and a
less exalted hope, we must not complain or wonder, if we lose our
object and aim; &ldquo;Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for
whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap; he that soweth
unto the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that
soweth unto the spirit, shall of the spirit reap life
everlasting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merciful God, when He created man innocent and happy,
graciously revealed to him the means, by which his innocence and
happiness might be preserved; and shewed thereby, that they were
inseparable, that the loss of the one would be the loss of the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <a name="page327"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 327</span>Lord God commanded the man, saying,
Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it;
for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
die.&rdquo; <a name="citation327a"></a><a href="#footnote327a"
class="citation">[327a]</a>&nbsp; And no sooner had Adam
disobeyed, no sooner was his innocence forfeited, than his
happiness was gone; he found to his sorrow, as he would not
believe to his comfort, the truth of his Creator&rsquo;s word:
and thus miserably ended the first covenant of God with man, the
covenant of obedience and works.</p>
<p>Under the covenant of grace, by the blessed and eternal Son of
God, it is revealed to us, with equal clearness, how the lost
happiness of man is to be recovered; &ldquo;the way we
know:&rdquo; &ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou
shalt be saved;&rdquo; <a name="citation327b"></a><a
href="#footnote327b" class="citation">[327b]</a> &ldquo;set your
affections on things above, not on things on the earth:&rdquo; <a
name="citation327c"></a><a href="#footnote327c"
class="citation">[327c]</a> this is the way, call it by what name
you please&mdash;a condition, or a means; it is the <a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>only way:
happiness, here or hereafter, is attainable in no other.&nbsp;
For this, we have the assurance of that word, which we have seen,
under the first covenant, awfully fulfilled; of that word, which
can never fail.&nbsp; My brethren, I cannot doubt, that we are
all of us convinced of this truth: then let us pray fervently and
faithfully, that the conviction may live in our hearts; that we
may, from this day forward, go to &ldquo;the fountain of living
waters, and not hew out for ourselves broken cisterns, that hold
no water;&rdquo; <a name="citation328a"></a><a
href="#footnote328a" class="citation">[328a]</a> that we may
renounce the vanity of all human inventions, and seek our
happiness in God, and God alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be not conformed to
this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind;
that ye may prove, what is that good and acceptable and perfect
will of God:&rdquo; <a name="citation328b"></a><a
href="#footnote328b" class="citation">[328b]</a> that ye may
&ldquo;have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting
life.&rdquo; <a name="citation328c"></a><a href="#footnote328c"

<span class="GutSmall">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD REVEALED TO THEM THAT
FEAR HIM.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Psalm</span> xxv. 14.</p>
<p><i>The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him</i>;
<i>and He will shew them His covenant</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> secret of the Lord means, that
which cannot be known unless the Lord reveal it; and the phrase
here implies, an intimate knowledge of the divine perfections, of
the dealings and dispensations of God; a holy and vital communion
with Him; an entire trust in His providential care and
government; together with that peace, which always dwells in the
bosom of a true, penitent, pious believer.&nbsp; All this, <a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>including,
as it does, a full acquaintance with the doctrines and duties,
the privileges and comforts of the life of faith, is called
&ldquo;the secret of the Lord,&rdquo; because it is hidden from
the natural man, and cannot possibly be comprehended or
discovered without divine revelation.</p>
<p>Such knowledge and such blessings are not the growth of earth;
they are not the produce of the human intellect or the human
heart; they must come by spiritual communication, from the
fountain of wisdom and truth.&nbsp; When man was driven from the
bright abode of paradise, his understanding was darkened; losing
the favour, he lost the image of his Maker, and thus became
naturally estranged from those holy thoughts and affections,
which constitute his chief happiness and glory.&nbsp; Nor is it
possible for him to recover this spiritual frame of mind, these
heavenly views, this holy and happy acquaintance with God, unless
the hand, by which the image was originally stamped, repair the
<a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>wretched
ruin in which it now lies.&nbsp; Whoever would know the ways of
God, must be taught of God; to all, who are not so taught, they
are impenetrably secret.&nbsp; Thus spake the wisest of men;
&ldquo;The Lord giveth wisdom, out of His mouth cometh knowledge
and understanding.&nbsp; Then shalt thou understand righteousness
and judgment and equity; yea, every good path.&rdquo; <a
name="citation331a"></a><a href="#footnote331a"
class="citation">[331a]</a>&nbsp; And thus the apostle,
&ldquo;Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered
into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them
that love Him;&rdquo; <a name="citation331b"></a><a
href="#footnote331b" class="citation">[331b]</a> that is, man, in
his natural state, of ignorance and rebellion against God, cannot
form a notion of the value of heavenly blessings; of the enlarged
views, the sublimed affections, the sustaining comforts and joys,
attainable by an inheritance of the divine promises, both here
and hereafter.&nbsp; But, as the apostle proceeds, &ldquo;God
hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit; for the Spirit
searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God.&nbsp; For <a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>what man
knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of a man which is in
him; even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of
God;&rdquo; as we exercise our thoughts and judgment upon human
matters, by the help of human reason, by the natural powers of
the mind, so must we attain the knowledge of divine matters, by
the aid of a divine spirit; by a holy illumination and guidance;
not indeed by miraculous illapses, but still by the distinct and
actual operation of heavenly grace, silently producing its
effects upon the understanding and heart.</p>
<p>The pride of man, the disputer of this world, does not submit
to this proposition and teaching; perhaps commonly regards them
in the light of enthusiasm; he has no notion, that there are any
secrets in religion, which his own skill and judgment are not
sufficient to reveal; he disbelieves every thing, which he cannot
comprehend or feel; and affects to throw a shade of discredit and
contempt upon all those religious sentiments and affections, to
which <a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>he
is a stranger.&nbsp; There are not a few such persons in the
christian world; who profess to believe all the doctrines of the
Bible, and to know all that need or can be known, and yet never
submit themselves to, scarcely can be said to pray for or desire,
the aid and direction of Almighty God; who imagine, that their
liberal education and their common sense entitle them to pass a
full and adequate judgment upon all spiritual subjects; and to
form a correct notion of all spiritual privileges and
blessings.</p>
<p>This is a dangerous and fatal error; a most unfounded
presumption; a gross ignorance of the very element and nature of
evangelical truth: such persons only judge of the word of God, of
the ordinances and benefits of religion, as they would judge of
any mere human history; of any worldly occurrence or advantage:
they take, what they are pleased to call, a rational view of
Christianity; but the only view, which deserves the name of
rational, is, not that which appeals to <a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>reason
alone, but that which is according to truth; according to the
acknowledged revelation of God&rsquo;s sovereign will.&nbsp; Let
us again hear the apostle: &ldquo;Which things also we speak, not
in the words which man&rsquo;s wisdom teacheth, but which the
Holy Ghost teacheth.&mdash;But the natural man receiveth not the
things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him,
neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned.&rdquo; <a name="citation334"></a><a
href="#footnote334" class="citation">[334]</a>&nbsp; The merely
rational man, therefore, is a carnal man; not indeed an absolute
stranger to the word of grace, but unenlightened by it; he has no
true taste for holy and divine things; it is altogether
impossible for him to appreciate their merits, or to know any
thing of their practical effects.</p>
<p>A familiar instance or two may serve to illustrate this
truth.&nbsp; How can any man, who neglects the worship of God,
pretend to decide upon its importance and utility?&nbsp; How can
he presume to deny its comfortable and salutary influence <a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>upon the
soul, its powerful efficacy upon the character and life?&nbsp; It
is a matter of experience; of which he therefore is unqualified
to judge.&mdash;He that is a stranger to the grace of God in his
heart, may despise those, that regard it and live by it, as
fanatical persons, who are deluded by visionary ideas and
groundless assurances: but he is only judging others by himself;
and it would be marvellous indeed, if he, who is avowedly living
without the influence of divine grace, should bear witness to the
benefit and happiness which it confers.&mdash;What can the
intemperate man know of the blessings of temperance?&nbsp;
Nothing: except by the want of them.&mdash;What can the covetous
man know of the pleasures of benevolence and
liberality?&mdash;the licentious of the excellence of purity, or
the ignorant of the treasures of wisdom?&mdash;Because the
sinner, when overtaken by sickness or affliction, declares that
he derives no comfort from religion, are we therefore to
conclude, that religion <a name="page336"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 336</span>has no comforts at all?&nbsp; Could
we think it probable, that the promises of the gospel would
afford consolation to him, in an evil hour, when he had all along
been an alien to their nature, when they had been unheeded or
despised?</p>
<p>It is quite clear, that the benefits and blessings of our holy
religion, that the knowledge of God&rsquo;s word, the power of
His Spirit, and the effects of His ordinances, must ever remain a
secret to those, who have no intercourse with these things, and
set their hearts against them.&nbsp; And whenever the Christian
hears his conduct condemned, or his hopes undervalued, by such
persons, he may treat them, not with proud disdain, but with a
holy disregard: whatever their station in society may be,
whatever their learning, whatever their reputation for judgment
in worldly affairs, upon spiritual or scriptural matters their
opinion is of no weight or worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The secret of the Lord is with them that fear
Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fear of the Lord, <a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>in this
passage, as in many others of Holy writ, denotes the sum and
substance of religion; it implies a sincere faith and trust in
God, an awful sense of His majesty, an humble and anxious enquiry
after the knowledge of His will, with a holy determination of
obedience.&nbsp; And, in addressing these words to a christian
congregation, we may understand them as implying that fear and
service of God, which proceed from a vital belief in the whole of
His revealed law, in the gospel of His ever blessed Son, our
supreme Lawgiver and King; as implying moreover an entire
concurrence in all the measures ordained for our salvation.&nbsp;
The fear of God, though common to all believers under every
divine dispensation, will vary in its operation and extent,
according to the nature and fulness of their dispensation; it
will lead them to believe and love and obey, according to their
knowledge, to their opportunities and means of grace, and
therefore the believer in the gospel shews the working of this <a
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>holy
principle in the full bearing of evangelical fruit.</p>
<p>All who so believe and live, shall have the secret of the Lord
abundantly revealed; &ldquo;He that hath My commandments, and
keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me
shall be loved of My Father; and I will love him and will
manifest Myself unto him.&nbsp; The Comforter, which is the Holy
Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you
all things.&rdquo; <a name="citation338"></a><a
href="#footnote338" class="citation">[338]</a>&nbsp; The humble
disciples of Christ are blest in all their researches after
divine truth and knowledge: when they contemplate the perfections
of the Godhead, their capacities are enlarged, their affections
devoutly engaged, their hearts disposed to profit withal.&nbsp; A
deep sense of the majesty and power of Jehovah leads them to
reverence Him; a sense of His justice leads them to walk
uprightly; of His omnipresence, to live holily; of His goodness,
to serve Him with gratitude and love.&nbsp; Whilst the cold
philosopher, <a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
339</span>whilst the worldly-minded and the sinner view these
great subjects only with a theoretical eye, without any moral or
religious improvement, the spiritual believer is powerfully moved
and affected; and walks in the light of truth every day and
hour.</p>
<p>In their devotional exercises, the faithful servants of the
Lord are peculiarly blessed; are made sensible of His presence
and His power.&nbsp; When they pour forth their prayers and
praises at the throne of grace; when they thus hold a nearer
communion with their reconciled God, a heavenly tranquillity and
delight are spread over their souls; they know and feel their
connexion with &ldquo;the Father of spirits,&rdquo; and they rise
from their devotion with an humble confidence, that the tribute
of their heart has been accepted; that their fervent
supplications will be answered, in God&rsquo;s appointed time and
way, through the merits and intercession of a merciful
Redeemer.&nbsp; To these inspiring hopes and persuasions the
impenitent sinner is an <a name="page340"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 340</span>utter stranger: if he prays at all,
it is but the outward service of the lips; there can be nothing
of the spiritual principle of devotion, and therefore nothing of
its fruit.</p>
<p>Again: when the humble pious believer sits down to the study
of the Bible, with a pure desire to discover and perform the holy
will of God; to be nourished with the bread of life; and to draw,
from the fountain of truth, the waters of eternal salvation; the
grace of the Holy Spirit is with him, to remove the veil from his
corrupt heart, and thus to open and enlarge his understanding: by
this means he perceives &ldquo;the wondrous things&rdquo; of the
divine law, and applies them for his own personal edification and
comfort.&nbsp; The true import of the doctrines, there contained,
is progressively unfolded to his view; and the full bearing, of
every precept and rule of life, is pressed with increasing force
and authority upon his heart.&nbsp; He admires and reverences the
holy book; he loves <a name="page341"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 341</span>all that it contains; his soul is
rapt in the contemplation of the stupendous mystery of goodness
and godliness; it elevates his prospects and affections above
this lower world; he has &ldquo;tasted the good word of God, and
the powers of the world to come;&rdquo; <a
name="citation341"></a><a href="#footnote341"
class="citation">[341]</a> he beholds, with the eye of faith, his
inheritance in the skies; and this his heavenly view brightens as
he advances.</p>
<p>Every sincere Christian can bear witless, that his
acquaintance with the word of life is continually improving; that
in every page, and almost in every passage, he is perpetually
discovering fresh truth and beauty, fresh obligations and
delights.&nbsp; Of all this, the carnal-minded and the sinner are
profoundly ignorant; to them the Bible is comparatively a dead
letter: they see little of its harmony or its excellency; and
where they do see, it has no lively or permanent effect upon
their heart; no more, than any other book, of history, or
morality, or amusement.</p>
<p><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>The
righteous are not free from suffering and pain, from trials and
afflictions; but then they enjoy, under every visitation, a
source of comfort and satisfaction, which the thoughtless
votaries of this world cannot possibly experience.&nbsp; There
dwelleth, in their hearts and minds, the peace of God; and that
must ever be the gift of God, which He will never bestow upon His
enemies; the peace of God, which fills them with a holy calm, and
reconciles them to every thing.&nbsp; In seasons of trouble, the
triumphs of the gospel are especially manifested; and the
&ldquo;secret of the Lord&rdquo; especially revealed.&nbsp; The
soul is in a more impressible condition; more ready to learn of
Him, who &ldquo;was meek and lowly of heart;&rdquo; and therefore
more capable of the enjoyment of His promised rest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be
comforted.&rdquo; <a name="citation342"></a><a
href="#footnote342" class="citation">[342]</a></p>
<p>The sensual and the proud are disappointed and mortified and
rebellious under <a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
343</span>the various troubles of life; the Christian receives
them in a different spirit, as tokens of his heavenly
Father&rsquo;s love; and tokens of love he finds them to
be.&nbsp; They, who &ldquo;walk by sight,&rdquo; are ever
complaining of hardships and inequalities in the world; they who
&ldquo;walk by faith,&rdquo; can perceive in them all the
sovereign and gracious hand of the Almighty, who &ldquo;doeth all
things well.&rdquo;&nbsp; They, who live upon the favour of the
world, must always be rendered unhappy by its frowns; but the
Christian lives above it, and cares little for any opposition or
evil report: he is fortified and comforted by a secret power, and
protected by an invisible arm: and this power shall continue with
him, if he continue faithful, even unto the end.&nbsp; When his
journey through the wilderness is about to terminate, when he has
arrived at the borders of the flood, and is entering upon the
shores of the heavenly Canaan, when nature sinks and the soul is
departing, then does the Lord reveal himself, in a manner not to
be seen and not <a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
344</span>to be told: there is a hidden energy, a light within, a
sustaining spirit, a mysterious and merciful communion with the
Lord of life and death.&nbsp; This indeed is an awful secret, and
one which the guilty can never know; which none can know, who do
not, with all their heart and soul, embrace the promises of
salvation revealed to them in the gospel: the foretaste of
heavenly rest, like the rest itself, remaineth only for the
people of God.&nbsp; They who have so feared and loved the Lord,
as to have served Him with a good conscience and with integrity;
they who have so believed and trusted in their Saviour, as to
have followed whithersoever He led, as to have sacrificed every
unholy gratification and pursuit, for the love of His name and
for the &ldquo;one thing needful,&rdquo; they shall find, in
their latter moments, a peace known only to themselves, a joy
with which no &ldquo;stranger can intermeddle.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Lord will effectually &ldquo;shew them His covenant:&rdquo; they
were made by baptism &ldquo;members of Christ and children <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>of
God,&rdquo; and became thereby entitled, through the free mercy
of God in Jesus Christ, to an &ldquo;inheritance in the kingdom
of heaven;&rdquo; having abided in that covenant, and walked
faithfully therein, they will never doubt, but God will assuredly
perform His part; and He will give them a full insight into the
blessings, which He has covenanted to bestow; they have all along
entertained a lively apprehension of the nature and principles of
this holy covenant, and of their own correspondent obligations;
its holy promises and its gracious rewards have been through life
the solace of their souls; and it continues, yea increases, to
the last; not indeed enjoyed in perfection here below, but
enjoyed as the earnest and pledge of the fulness of their eternal
felicity.</p>
<p>In this manner, my brethren, &ldquo;acquaint yourselves with
God,&rdquo; and come to the true knowledge of His perfections and
His ways, and live in the animating ennobling hope of a brighter
manifestation of His glory hereafter&mdash;in this manner, by <a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>a spirit of
humble, faithful, entire dependence upon Him, through the mercy
of Jesus Christ; by fervent importunate prayer for the
illumination and aid of the Holy Ghost; by &ldquo;seeking first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness by loving Him with all
the heart and soul,&rdquo; and &ldquo;walking in His fear all the
day long.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus are we to be taught of God, thus only
can we acquire a capability and disposition to be taught; thus
growing in grace, we grow in wisdom, in holy experience, in happy
communion with our Lord and Saviour.</p>
<p>Receive this instruction, &ldquo;high and low, rich and poor,
one with another;&rdquo; it is equally necessary for all.&nbsp;
Unless this spiritual lesson be learnt, the stores of human
science, the treasures of human wisdom, are vain and worthless;
they can impart no knowledge, no true and saving knowledge, of
the ways and dealings of the Most High; they cannot bring the
sinner to his Maker: on the contrary, they prevent and hinder
him, by ministering a <a name="page347"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 347</span>spirit of pride and
self-sufficiency.&nbsp; If thou wouldest know God, fear Him, and
be taught of His Spirit and His word; this is His own appointed
means, and there is no other.&nbsp; And ye poor, unlearned as ye
may be, seek the Lord in this way, and ye shall assuredly find
Him: His secret shall be with you; and He will graciously teach
you more, than you can attain from all the world besides; more
than the wisest can learn in any other way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way of the wicked is as darkness; they know not at
what they stumble: but the path of the just is as the shining
light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.&rdquo; <a
name="citation347"></a><a href="#footnote347"
class="citation">[347]</a>&nbsp; The Lord revealeth Himself unto
the righteous, day by day; they grow in wisdom, as in years: the
nearer they approach to the completion of their hopes, to the end
of their earthly pilgrimage, to their heavenly and eternal
kingdom, the clearer will be their knowledge, and the more
delightful their anticipations; even until that day, when the <a
name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>veil of the
flesh shall be utterly removed, when they shall &ldquo;see their
God face to face, and know even as also they are known.&rdquo; <a

<span class="GutSmall">RESIST THE BEGINNINGS OF EVIL
TEMPTATION.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Proverbs</span> iv. 14, 15.</p>
<p><i>Enter not into the path of the wicked</i>, <i>and go not in
the way of evil men</i>.&nbsp; <i>Avoid it</i>, <i>pass not by
it</i>, <i>turn from it and pass away</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is one of those short,
comprehensive, moral directions, with which the holy Scriptures
abound, for our safe conduct in life; directions, that are seldom
attended to with the earnestness, which their importance
demands.&nbsp; Studied such words should be, with devout
meditation and the spirit of prayer; imprinted on the memory,
fixed in the heart.&nbsp; We <a name="page350"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 350</span>are apt to trust too much to
generalities in religion; we do not sufficiently concern
ourselves with its individual precepts and practical
admonitions.&nbsp; And I wish now to enlarge upon this point,
before we enter into a consideration of the text; hoping that it
may induce you, by God&rsquo;s help, &ldquo;to take heed how ye
hear&rdquo; such lessons of instruction.</p>
<p>For the attainment of a religious character, and the means of
walking holily and uprightly in our course through life,
doubtless the main thing is, to establish sound principles in the
heart; and without such principles all the rules and helps in the
world will prove of little avail; never to be depended upon in
the hour of temptation and trial.&nbsp; Accordingly we find, in
the word of God, these mainsprings of action continually insisted
on, as of the highest necessity to be settled in the soul.&nbsp;
A true, a right faith is inculcated, as the great foundation of
all spiritual obedience; a vital faith in God, as our Creator,
Redeemer, and Sanctifier; <a name="page351"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 351</span>a faith in His revealed word, in all
the great doctrines of life and salvation there propounded to
fallen man; a faith in the necessity of obeying all the
commandments therein delivered for the formation of our character
and the regulation of our lives; a faith in the world to come,
after the death of the body; a world depending, for happiness or
misery, upon our choice and conduct here.&nbsp; The love of God
and the fear of God are also laid down as most powerful
principles of thought and action; as spreading an influence over
the whole of our behaviour.</p>
<p>Still however, the establishment of these first principles is
not of itself sufficient for the complete direction and
government of our lives.&nbsp; So manifold and various are the
temptations to which we are exposed; so numerous the trials we
are called to bear, that particular instructions and commands are
also needful for us, in order that we may be prepared to meet the
different circumstances which are perpetually arising, in order
that we may be <a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>taught how to reduce our principles to practice; and to
apply the declaration of God&rsquo;s will to our ordinary
intercourse and experience with the world.</p>
<p>For this purpose, we find the old scriptures every where
abounding with rules, for the performance of every duty, and the
avoidance of every sin: for the immediate service and worship of
God, for the discharge of every honest and honourable obligation
we owe to our neighbour; for the correction of all those evil
affections and passions, to which the corrupt heart of man is so
lamentably prone.&nbsp; Nor in the new testament, where the
foundation of faith is more clearly and broadly laid down, are
such rules less frequent, or less urgently enforced.&nbsp; We
might indeed expect, what actually is the case, that as a clearer
and fuller revelation, that as a higher principle and view, would
require a more holy and perfect observance, a greater purity and
integrity and blamelessness of character, therefore the several
duties demanded of us, in our <a name="page353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>walk with God, would be laid down
and marked with the greater accuracy.&nbsp; Accordingly we do
find, for this purpose, &ldquo;line upon line and precept upon
precept&rdquo; repeated and urged with the greater fulness and
particularity; that we may not, by any unholiness or deficiency
in our conduct, disgrace that more glorious revelation, with
which we have been favoured as believers in the gospel of Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; Look at His own blessed discourses, especially His
sermon on the mount; look at the epistles, which His servants,
inspired by the Holy Ghost, have left for our guidance and
government; and see what full instructions they contain, for our
duty to God and our duty to man.&nbsp; It is wonderful, for how
many cases they provide; for how many instances in our daily
experience; how they teach us, on the one hand, the practice of
every virtue, shew all the bearings of it and the steps that lead
to it; how they caution us, on the other, against every besetting
sin; how they point out the <a name="page354"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 354</span>manner, in which it gains an
influence over us, and cut it up by the root.</p>
<p>I have embraced the present opportunity of enlarging on this
point, with a view of awakening your attention to, and inducing
you to study and treasure up, the various scriptural rules for
holy living: I have done this, because many suppose, that the
fixing of a good principle&mdash;of faith, for instance,&mdash;is
all that is requisite; if it were so, why should so many rules
have been given in that holy book, in which there can be nothing
unnecessary or superfluous?&nbsp; God, who knows the heart and
all the ways of man, knew how wise and needful it was, to deliver
express admonitions and exhortations to each individual duty;
that our faith might not be vague and unprofitable, but abounding
in fruit, in the fruit of holiness unto everlasting life.</p>
<p>But it is time now to turn to the text, which furnishes us
with one of the most important cautions for our safe and
christian government.&nbsp; It might be thought, <a
name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 355</span>that every
true believer in that blessed Redeemer, who came &ldquo;to
cleanse him from all unrighteousness,&rdquo; would have such a
horror of sin, as effectually to secure him from its dominion; as
to prevent us from the necessity of admonishing him against its
fascination and its power; but such unhappily is far from being
the case.&nbsp; Many, who make a considerable profession of the
gospel, are betrayed into grievous inconsistencies; many, who set
out with promising hopes and good resolutions, are led astray and
overcome; many, for want of attending to the warning given in the
text, for want of narrowly watching the beginnings of evil.&nbsp;
Feeling a sincere and decided abhorrence of the grosser sins,
they expose themselves without fear to slighter temptations;
should they be, in some small matter, inveigled and led into the
path of error, it is expected that they shall instantly perceive
their danger; that they shall repent and be forgiven, and be more
guarded and resolute for the time to come.</p>
<p><a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>But
they have not formed a proper estimate of the seducing nature of
sin; they know not how the power of the tempter increases with
every success: instead of their being alarmed and disgusted with
the first commission, they become, from the corruption of their
nature, the more captivated and seduced: it is easier for the
enemy to draw them on to the second step, than it was to persuade
them to the first; their conscience becomes more easily silenced
and reconciled; they begin to think, that the strictness, for
which they once contended, is not so requisite; they become
accustomed to evil; make excuses for it; take delight in it; are
flattered with the empty praises and congratulations of their new
companions; and proceed by degrees to abandoned and ruinous
lengths.&nbsp; The fact is, that they have been all the while
provoking the Spirit of the Lord to desert them: He was grieved
at their very first departure, from the path of innocence and
integrity; it shewed a carelessness of the ways of God; it
argued, <a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>that His fear and His love were declining in their
heart: with every renewed commission of evil, the Spirit was more
and more quenched, till at length He left them to themselves;
weak, helpless, incapable of resistance; in the dominion of the
enemy, slaves of sin.</p>
<p>What I am here describing, has been the miserable experience
of thousands of unwatchful and irresolute Christians; who have
fallen into the snare, yea at last into the ruinous abyss of
evil, from which they have never afterwards escaped, because they
were too &ldquo;wise in their own conceits&rdquo; and too
confident in their own strength, to take a warning against the
peril of yielding to the first temptation; because they ventured
into the borders of forbidden ground, and were insensibly led on
to the fatal lengths, which they once held in abomination.</p>
<p>How many a youth have we known, trained from his earliest
infancy in the holy principles of the gospel, the hope and the
promise of his anxious parents, <a name="page358"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 358</span>the joy of his family and friends,
yet, from incautiously listening, on some unsuspected occasion,
to the advice of an evil counsellor, and induced to make
experiment of some unhallowed pleasure, thereby shaken in his
integrity and thrown off his bias; prevailed upon to repeat the
pressing indulgence; thence to proceed to others; till, in the
end, the character has been totally changed,&mdash;marred,
corrupted, ruined.&nbsp; It seemed but a little matter that first
courted his consent; what, though sinful pleasures did surround
him in his new scene and his new company, he, poor innocent
youth, had no intention of joining in them; was determined to
stand aloof.&nbsp; For a while he did so; and maintained the
pious and virtuous and christian habits, in which he had been
trained; the habits of prayer, and holy reading, and holy
meditation, and uprightness of conduct: but he began to give way,
to &ldquo;fall from the stedfastness of his faith in
Christ;&rdquo; <a name="citation358"></a><a href="#footnote358"
class="citation">[358]</a> one religious observance after <a
name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 359</span>another was
broken in upon; one scruple after another overcome; till at last
he was stripped of every portion of the garment of righteousness,
and left &ldquo;miserable and poor and naked,&rdquo; with nothing
to hide his wretchedness and shame; the dishonour of his father,
the grief of his mother&rsquo;s heart; disowned by his family,
disowned by his God: a misery to himself; dying the death of a
sinner.&nbsp; And whence came all this load of misery upon
him?&mdash;on account of his first unguarded yielding.</p>
<p>This representation has been but too frequently verified: yet
not to the young only has such heedlessness proved a snare and
destruction.&nbsp; We may see its consequences ravaging around us
almost every day; in persons of every age and condition.&nbsp;
How many a sabbath-breaker has contracted his dreadful habit from
a very small beginning of neglect?&nbsp; At the first he was
tempted very occasionally to absent himself from the House of his
God; to indulge now and then, extremely seldom, <a
name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>in worldly
pleasure; or to engage, in a thoughtless hour, in the dispatch of
worldly business; but his affection and reverence for the holy
day by degrees grow colder, and the temptations became stronger:
the Lord&rsquo;s House was, in a great measure, forsaken; the
Lord&rsquo;s day became his day of dissolute pleasure; or his day
of business and accounts, as best suited his condition; and hence
followed, as it must of necessity, the total decay of religious
principle and religious character.</p>
<p>Thus it is also, in a remarkable degree, with the vice of
intemperance; no man proceeds to its abominable and fatal
extremities all at once: but no man, whatever his principles may
have been, is secure from its horrible influence, if he is once
tempted habitually to depart from the holy rules of sobriety;
however seldom the habit may be at first indulged.&nbsp; It is
indeed especially true of this awful vice, that if the enemy once
gains a footing in the heart, he seldom leaves it, till the heart
is his own.</p>
<p><a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 361</span>Thus
it is, once again, with evil company of every description; it is
ensnaring beyond all suspicion, and beyond all calculation:
wicked or worldly companions infuse their venom, into the mind
and the bosom, gradually and insensibly: even if they have no
intention so to do, as in truth they too often have, their very
presence and conversation and habits are so corrupting, that it
is impossible for any one, who is familiarly acquainted with
them, to escape the contagion; in fact, whoever seeks, or whoever
tolerates such company, has a lurking disposition to evil, though
it may be unperceived and unsuspected by himself.&nbsp; Flee from
every approach to this treacherous and dangerous ground, as you
would &ldquo;flee from the wrath to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this statement, which indeed is but imperfect and feeble
in comparison with the magnitude of the evil, against which I am
seeking to warn you, my hearers; from this you may be better
prepared, by God&rsquo;s grace, to receive and <a
name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>value and
apply the important admonition of the text: you will observe how
particularly, how urgently, with what repetition, what varied
forms of expression, the wise man delivers his charge; so
delivers it the more, because he speaks feelingly, from
dear-bought experience; because he himself had been lamentably
ensnared, for want of attending to it in his own case.</p>
<p>Let us hearken to the counsel of this inspired and experienced
guide: he says, &ldquo;Enter not into the path of the
wicked;&rdquo; never be prevailed upon to set your foot on this
forbidden ground; &ldquo;go not in the way of evil men,&rdquo;
trust not yourself in their company or in any of their goings:
further he says, &ldquo;Avoid it,&rdquo; avoid this ensnaring
way; be at pains to keep clear of it; use your utmost
watchfulness to discover it; go in another direction, in the way
of the upright and holy.&nbsp; And, as if this caution were
insufficient for his purpose, he adds, &ldquo;Pass not by
it;&rdquo; suffer not yourself even to approach it, to look <a
name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>upon it;
lest you be beguiled by its false charms, and unwarily led to
desire them.&nbsp; Not willing yet to cease from admonishing, in
order to make a yet deeper impression, he concludes, &ldquo;Turn
from it and pass away;&rdquo; the instant you perceive it, turn
round with the dread of danger; as you would if you discovered
yourself on the edge of a precipice, in fear of falling headlong;
turn at once, and pass decidedly and quickly away.</p>
<p>In obedience to these rules, my brethren, consists our great
security, under the guidance of infinite wisdom and the support
of almighty power: the grace of God is ever ready to be bestowed,
ever at hand to &ldquo;preserve us from falling;&rdquo; but God
expects and requires us, in the use of this grace, to employ
every means of prudence, and to strive with a holy and unbending
resolution: this grace is afforded for the very purpose, that we
may so watch and work; and if we do not thus improve it, with
circumspection and diligence, it will be withdrawn.&nbsp; Never
so <a name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 364</span>much
as listen to any sinful proposal, to any doubtful invitation;
stay not to reason upon it at all; turn away with holy jealousy;
never suffer the eye to dwell upon a forbidden object, to dwell
even for a moment; through the eye it may find a passage to the
heart, and inflame it with unlawful and hurtful desire: resist at
once; the first victory is the easiest, as well as the
surest.&nbsp; Say to the temptation, as your Lord said to the
tempter, &ldquo;get thee hence, Satan;&rdquo; &ldquo;flee from
him and he will flee from you&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;escape for thy
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here I must add an observation upon the means, by which we
may be enabled to follow this momentous advice of the wisest of
men.&nbsp; We must &ldquo;watch and pray, that we enter not into
temptation;&rdquo; <a name="citation364"></a><a
href="#footnote364" class="citation">[364]</a> we must go forth
into the world in the spirit of watchfulness and prayer; praying,
not only that we may have the grace to watch, but also when the
trial actually arises, when we are watching.&nbsp; In the
presence of temptation, <a name="page365"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 365</span>or if we do but perceive or suspect
that it is coming, let the soul be lifted up to the &ldquo;Lord
of all power and might;&rdquo; let the language of the heart, if
not of the lips, be poured forth in pious aspiration to God; if
it be but a word, a wish, or a thought, it will be clothed with
strength, and minister a stedfastness to the mind and
heart.&nbsp; We are thus animated by the assurance of divine
support, and fixed in our holy determination of resistance to all
evil.&nbsp; Much depends, for safety and success, upon this
habitual spirit of devotion; it is our buckler and shield in
every moment of conflict; without it, we are standing, in the
feebleness of nature, before the mighty enemy of our souls; ready
to &ldquo;be taken captive by him at his will.&rdquo; <a
name="citation365a"></a><a href="#footnote365a"
class="citation">[365a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Be ye therefore sober
(that is, be serious) and watch unto prayer;&rdquo; <a
name="citation365b"></a><a href="#footnote365b"
class="citation">[365b]</a> and thus &ldquo;go forth conquering
and to conquer.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE LOVE OF CHRIST FOR THOSE WHO DO THE
WILL OF GOD.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Mark</span> iii. 35.</p>
<p><i>Whosoever shall do the will of God</i>, <i>the same is my
brother and my sister and mother</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> this, and one or two other
passages in the gospels, it has been sometimes imagined, that our
blessed Lord set no value on the common relationships, the
natural ties, the tender endearments of life; and that He
intended to teach His disciples, by His own example, to neglect
such considerations altogether; as if all Christians had an equal
claim upon our affection; as if the spiritual brotherhood <a
name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 367</span>were the
only object worthy of our regard; as if parents and brothers and
sisters were merely upon a footing with the rest of
mankind.&nbsp; This notion is entirely erroneous; it is a
mistaken conclusion from the words and conduct of our Lord.</p>
<p>His own example, on several occasions, has afforded a sanction
to the feelings of private friendship, as well as of family
affection.&nbsp; How deeply was He moved at the death of
Lazarus!&nbsp; &ldquo;Jesus wept, then said the Jews, behold how
He loved him!&rdquo; <a name="citation367a"></a><a
href="#footnote367a" class="citation">[367a]</a> And of our
Lord&rsquo;s disciples we read, that there was one, treated with
peculiar tenderness and regard; one, &ldquo;who leaned on His
bosom;&rdquo; <a name="citation367b"></a><a href="#footnote367b"
class="citation">[367b]</a> one, distinguished by the high and
honourable name of the &ldquo;beloved disciple.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
this disciple, the evangelist St. John, has drawn one of the most
striking pictures of an affectionate family, ever represented to
the eye and the heart of man: &ldquo;There stood by the cross of
Jesus, His mother, and <a name="page368"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 368</span>His mother&rsquo;s sister, Mary the
wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.&nbsp; When Jesus therefore
saw His mother, and the disciple standing by whom He loved, He
saith unto His mother, Woman, behold thy son!&nbsp; Then saith He
to the disciple, Behold thy mother!&nbsp; And from that hour that
disciple took her unto his own home.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jesus not only
loved and protected His mother through life, but was solicitous
to provide for her future well-being, even amidst the agonies of
the cross; commending her to His dearest personal friend; and by
way of effectually securing <i>his</i> regard and <i>her</i>
confidence, He calls John the son, and Mary the mother: Behave to
each other as mother and son; and it is all I can ask or
require.&nbsp; This must be admitted as a proof, that Jesus felt
most tenderly and peculiarly for His nearest earthly relation:
and it shews, that those passages, which have been supposed to
favour a contrary opinion, have been wrongly interpreted.</p>
<p><a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 369</span>Let
us now consider the circumstances which led to the declaration in
the text.&nbsp; It appears, that the earnestness and perseverance
of Jesus in teaching the people, notwithstanding the opposition
of the Pharisees, had given disquietude to His friends and
brethren, that is, to His near relations, some of whom did not
believe in Him.&nbsp; They seem to have desired Him to forbear
and discontinue His ministry at that particular time, supposing
that He had exceeded the bounds of prudence; and it further
appears, that they had induced Mary, His mother, to concur in
this improper design; which conveyed a reflection upon His
wisdom, and the perfection of His character.&nbsp; They came,
therefore, when He was teaching the people; and, not being able
to approach Him for the multitude, they sent to speak with
Him.&nbsp; But Jesus, aware of their intention, answered by
enquiring, who His mother and brethren were; thereby intimating,
that they had no right to interfere on such an occasion, nor had
any authority over <a name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
370</span>Him in respect of His important work; that His
spiritual affection to His disciples, in the advancement of their
eternal interests, was greater than any natural affection, which
He bore to His relations, in a mere earthly point of view; that
His love to men&rsquo;s souls had the greatest consideration and
weight with Him; that even His mother was nearer to Him as a true
believer, than on account of her natural relationship; and that
His brethren would derive no advantage or favour from Him, if
they were not also believers.</p>
<p>Jesus then proceeded to declare, that His true disciples, even
though they had no connexion with Him by the natural tie of
blood, would be regarded in the light of relations; would be the
objects of His sincere affection and esteem; &ldquo;He looked
round on them which sat about Him, and said, Behold My mother and
My brethren, for whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is
My brother and My sister and mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; We cannot but
observe, that <a name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
371</span>these words are addressed, not merely to the disciples
of that day, but to every individual Christian throughout the
world; <i>whosoever</i>, of any age or nation, should do the will
of His heavenly Father, by hearing, believing, obeying His
revealed word, by embracing the gospel of salvation, he would, in
life, in death, in judgment, and for ever, be honoured and
blessed; even as the brother, sister, or mother of Him, who is
the Lord of all, and the King of glory.</p>
<p>How encouraging, how delightful an assurance, to be persuaded,
that in all our difficulties and troubles, in all our
bereavements and desertions and afflictions, through this vale of
tears, we have a friend, a relation, at the right hand of God,
the omnipotent Redeemer; who is advanced, after His earthly
humiliation, to the throne above, for the very purpose of
&ldquo;receiving gifts for men;&rdquo; and of distributing them
for the relief and assistance of all His loving and faithful
brethren.&nbsp; How fortunate do the needy children of men esteem
<a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
372</span>themselves, if they have a kind relative or friend in a
high quarter; one possessed of honour and wealth and power.&nbsp;
They feel themselves ennobled by the connexion; and are raised
above the fear and apprehension of want, by a confidence in his
influence and generosity.&nbsp; But what are the highest and
greatest of earthly relatives, in comparison with the glorious
everlasting Son of God; with Him who &ldquo;hath put all our
enemies under His feet;&rdquo; with the &ldquo;high and holy one
that inhabited eternity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earthly friends may and do fail, often when they are most
needed; an untoward occurrence, a groundless displeasure arises;
and all our expectations from them are suddenly swept away.&nbsp;
But with Jesus &ldquo;there is no variableness, neither shadow of
turning:&rdquo; He searches our hearts; and as long as they are
really and stedfastly united with Him, no casualties, no outward
appearances can estrange us from His favour.&nbsp; Earthly
friends die, one after another; and often at a time, when they <a
name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 373</span>are become
most dear and most necessary to us; but Jesus liveth for
evermore; and the union, we form with Him, is in no danger of
being severed by any change of time or circumstance; but goes on
progressively and perpetually increasing.&nbsp; The very
disasters, which often tend to disunite us from our earthly
friends and brethren, serve but to bind us the more closely to
the Saviour; in adversity, in poverty, in contempt, in
persecution, we find Him the nearer and dearer; always most ready
to succour us, when most wanted and desired: always ready, and
always able.&nbsp; So that, if the whole world were to fail us,
His abiding favour would more than counterbalance all the evils
of our lot.&nbsp; &ldquo;When even my father or my mother
forsaketh me, the Lord taketh me up;&rdquo; <a
name="citation373"></a><a href="#footnote373"
class="citation">[373]</a> He is in the stead of parents, in the
stead of all: &ldquo;the Father of the fatherless, and the God of
the widow;&rdquo; the Lord of consolation, and the Lord of
love.&nbsp; The upholding of His Spirit will sustain our
infirmities; <a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
374</span>one beam of His gracious mercy will cheer all the
darkness, which the world casteth over our souls.</p>
<p>The disciples of Jesus experience His friendly comfort every
day and hour: even if there were no other world than this, they
feel themselves abundantly blessed in their connexion with Him,
by His present affection and grace; but there <i>is</i> another
world; where their joy and love will be continued, and their
union with Him perfected in glory.&nbsp; He is called, in
gracious condescension, &ldquo;the first-born among many
brethren;&rdquo; <a name="citation374a"></a><a
href="#footnote374a" class="citation">[374a]</a> He has suffered
and died and triumphed and risen again, risen &ldquo;as the first
fruits of them that sleep;&rdquo; <a name="citation374b"></a><a
href="#footnote374b" class="citation">[374b]</a> and His
brethren, &ldquo;who endure unto the end,&rdquo; shall also rise
from the sleep of death, and &ldquo;see Him as He is, and be like
Him:&rdquo; <a name="citation374c"></a><a href="#footnote374c"
class="citation">[374c]</a> they shall &ldquo;be the children of
God, being the children of the resurrection.&rdquo; <a
name="citation374d"></a><a href="#footnote374d"
class="citation">[374d]</a></p>
<p>And &ldquo;do not our hearts burn within <a
name="page375"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 375</span>us&rdquo;
at the representation of this blessedness?&nbsp; Do we not desire
the honour, the privilege, the advantage, the excellency of being
thus united, in a bond of holy endearment, to the glorious Son of
God, to the Saviour of our souls?&nbsp; Undoubtedly we do: unless
our understandings be so darkened and our affections so depraved
and debased, that we are incapable of choosing between good and
evil, that we &ldquo;put darkness for light and light for
darkness.&rdquo;&nbsp; There cannot be one amongst us, who does
not profess to set a value upon the favour and friendship of his
Lord; upon the relationship which, as christians, we are
graciously permitted to bear to Him.&nbsp; Not one of us would go
to rest, content and happy, with the prospect of being deprived
of this distinguished and heavenly blessing.&nbsp; Let us know
and remember then, that our relationship to Him is not like that
of earthly families, a mere name which we have inherited from
infancy; and which will necessarily continue without our care or
concern.&nbsp; We <a name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
376</span>became related to Him by our baptismal covenant; but
there must be something more than baptism; something more is
required than a mere profession, than an outward belonging to His
visible church, in order to our being acknowledged as His
brethren.&nbsp; Brethren by name all of us are; nay, we have been
spiritually admitted into holy connexion with Him: but Jesus
regards those only, as accepted members of His family, who
believe in Him with all their heart and soul; who look to Him,
with a single, entire, and constant dependence, for life and
salvation; those, who &ldquo;are daily renewed in the spirit of
their minds;&rdquo; and desire and strive to bring all their
affections into a righteous subjection to Him and His holy law;
those, in a word, &ldquo;who do the will of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We cannot sufficiently reprobate the practice of those
persons, who boastfully claim the Saviour as their
&ldquo;familiar friend,&rdquo; without an abiding concern and a
strenuous endeavour to walk as He walked, <a
name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 377</span>in all the
ways of spiritual and moral integrity.&nbsp; Consider, I pray
you, His own clear text on this point: &ldquo;If ye love Me, keep
My commandments:&rdquo; <a name="citation377"></a><a
href="#footnote377" class="citation">[377]</a> there can be no
other evidence of our saving interest in the Lord, but that which
He Himself has established.&nbsp; His true disciples and brethren
must bear His image; and not the marred, corrupted, hideous
likeness of the author of sin and death.&nbsp; This it is, to be
spiritually and effectually incorporated into the family of Jesus
Christ; thus is our relationship to be proved and cherished: he
that walketh as a brother and a friend, will be owned as such;
he, that faileth so to walk, will be disowned and cast away,
whatever his pretensions: &ldquo;better had it been for that man
if he had never been born;&rdquo; better still, if he had never
been born &ldquo;of water and the spirit;&rdquo; if he had never
&ldquo;named the name of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us then
faithfully remember, not only the joys and privileges of the
brethren of our Lord, but <a name="page378"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 378</span>the means also, which are absolutely
necessary for the proof and establishment of this holy title; the
conditions, the evidences, and the duties of so high and happy a
state.</p>
<p>And from our Lord&rsquo;s example in the instance before us,
we may gather several particulars for our instruction in life: He
gave His relations to understand, that it was not so much the
natural tie which He valued, as the spiritual; not, as we have
already explained, that He was devoid of natural affection, but
that the spiritual bond was of so much higher importance in His
esteem.&nbsp; In applying this principle for our adoption and
regulation, certainly great allowance must be made, and sound
discretion used; allowance for our mutual infirmities; and
discretion, for the sake of preserving domestic harmony and
peace.&nbsp; Far be it from us, to disclaim and renounce every
one of our family, who liveth not as a faithful follower of
Christ; he has a natural hold upon us, which must not be harshly
or hastily broken.</p>
<p><a name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
379</span>Independently of a universal feeling of benevolence for
all mankind; it is evidently the will of God, that the different
members of each family should be especially attached together,
for the sake of promoting each other&rsquo;s interest and
comfort; and thus of contributing to the good of society at
large; to the increase of the general stock of happiness, and the
diminution of evil.</p>
<p>And this, the design of a merciful Providence, which is
manifest to our common reason and our common feelings, is
abundantly verified and enforced by the holy word of God.&nbsp;
The fifth commandment in the law distinctly recognizes and
requires the exercise of domestic affection; and it is repeatedly
confirmed, under the gospel covenant, by the pen of an inspired
apostle.&nbsp; That apostle has farther declared, that &ldquo;if
any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own
house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an
infidel.&rdquo; <a name="citation379"></a><a href="#footnote379"
class="citation">[379]</a>&nbsp; And the sense <a
name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 380</span>of this
precept may be properly extended, to sanction and command all
those peculiar offices, of kindness and countenance and support,
which the members of a family can perform for each other.&nbsp;
Under ordinary circumstances therefore, if there be no opposing
necessity, the natural tie is to be respected by the Christian,
and bound upon his conscience and his heart.</p>
<p>Nor is such a connexion to be dissolved, but in cases of
extremity; for this among other reasons, that there is always a
hope, of the recreant and abandoned becoming, by the mercy of
God, at length reclaimed and converted; and of this great
blessing the pious relative may be made an instrument, by his
fervent prayer, his affectionate counsel, and the constant
influence of his good example.</p>
<p>But all this hinders us not from looking, with a very
different eye, upon the spiritual and the worldly relation; upon
the good and the evil; though both may be objects of our kind
personal offices, the nature and degree of our affection may <a
name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 381</span>vary most
exceedingly.&nbsp; Our love for the truly christian relative has
a fervour, a purity, a delight, which nothing but the mutual
working and spirit of religion can possibly generate: the
happiness proceeds from that sacred, heavenly source, from which
both of us draw our principles and hopes; from the consciousness
of our common interest in the great Redeemer, and our common
relationship to Him: we are both &ldquo;members of Christ and
children of God;&rdquo; inheritors of a better kingdom; to which
we are journeying together, and of which we love to be
discoursing; it is a bond of union, which nothing can separate;
not distance, not death: for this is the great consideration, the
great enhancement of our joy and comfort, that the love which we
are bearing for one another, in the kingdom of grace, shall be
renewed and matured in the kingdom of glory.&nbsp; And unless
there be this principle of attachment between relations, this
common faith and hope, this exercise of piety and godliness, this
interchange of holy affection, <a name="page382"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 382</span>all other attachments, however
requisite for this world, are but time-serving and poor: death
will be the dreadful extinction.&nbsp; But when the natural
affection is thus combined with the spiritual, and draws its
nourishment from it, they produce together a happiness, which
none but such relations can know.</p>
<p>And further, we are taught by this example of Christ, that
every sincere believer, with whom we are made acquainted, with
whom we have intercourse, is to be treated as a brother; whatever
be his situation in life, he is an object of affection far more
noble and delightful, than any human tie can possibly produce;
and is entitled to our best and most benevolent services.&nbsp;
We may not be familiarly associated; we may not dwell with him as
with an earthly relative; there may be a distance of rank between
us; but we love and honour him, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake and his
own sake, as one of God&rsquo;s redeemed people, with whom we
hope to dwell in love for ever; and therefore our soul delighteth
<a name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
383</span>&ldquo;to communicate with him and to do him
good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pity that there is not, in the christian
world, more of this spirit of the blessed Jesus; more friendly
sympathy and brotherly interchange; more regard for one another,
as members of the same holy family; the rich for the rich, the
poor for the poor, the rich and poor for each other.&nbsp; Far
different would be our condition in this world, if all were thus
regarding, thus feeling for, thus helping one another.&nbsp; Why
is it not so?&nbsp; For the want of a true christian faith and
principle.&nbsp; If the tree were good, the fruit would be thus
beautiful.</p>
<p>My brethren, allow me affectionately to recommend this subject
to your private and most serious consideration; to your daily
prayers; as a subject, in which your own interest in the Saviour
is deeply involved; as a subject, intimately connected with all
your best promises and hopes, in this life and the life to
come.&nbsp; And may the God of love shed His spirit abroad
amongst us, and &ldquo;pour into our hearts <a
name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>this most
excellent gift of charity, the very bond of peace and of all
virtues.&rdquo;&nbsp; Has Jesus, our common Lord and Master, our
heavenly and eternal King, declared, of every faithful disciple,
that &ldquo;the same is to Him, as a brother and sister and
mother?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then remember His example, and remember His
words, &ldquo;<i>as</i> I have loved you, that ye love one
another:&rdquo; remember them, or you will be forgotten by Him:
&ldquo;love the brotherhood,&rdquo; or you do not belong to
Christ; your profession is hypocrisy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Walk in love,
as Christ hath loved you;&rdquo; let it be your daily walk: the
reward is great, in every point of view; great upon earth, in
present comfort and peace and honour; greater on the latter day,
in the approving declaration of your Lord; &ldquo;Inasmuch as ye
have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have
done it unto Me:&rdquo; <a name="citation384"></a><a
href="#footnote384" class="citation">[384]</a> greatest in
heaven, where we shall be made &ldquo;perfect in love;&rdquo; in
the love of God, and of the holy angels, and all His redeemed
people, for ever and ever.</p>

385</span>SERMON XXI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON SEEKING OUT THE WORKS OF THE LORD AND
PRAISING HIM.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Psalm</span> cxi. 1. 2.</p>
<p><i>I will give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart</i>;
<i>in the assembly of the upright and in the
congregation</i>.</p>
<p><i>The works of the Lord are great</i>, <i>sought out of all
them that have pleasure therein</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the greatest hindrances to
the Christian life, in the true believer, is his perpetual
intermixture with the world, his constant occupation with the
business of his daily calling, with earthly pleasures and
pursuits.&nbsp; The world, in its very nature, in the spirit
which it breathes, in the <a name="page386"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 386</span>cares which it engenders, in the
temptations which it spreads, stands in opposition to the gospel,
to the Christian&rsquo;s walk with God; it unfits his mind for
spiritual contemplation; it gives him a disrelish for holy
delights; it calls aside his thoughts from God, from heaven, and
from heavenly things; and makes him forget his obligation to, and
dependence upon, the merciful and over-ruling providence of the
Most High.</p>
<p>And yet it is undoubtedly our duty to live in the world; to
partake, in a certain degree, of its pleasures, as well as of its
labours and cares.&nbsp; It is the will and decree of God, that
mankind should provide &ldquo;by the sweat of their brow&rdquo;
for their subsistence and well-being in life: integrity and
industry in the exercise of our calling are among the appointed
means, by which we must &ldquo;Work out our
salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since therefore we are obliged to mix
with the world, our great object should be, to guard against its
engrossing and corrupting influence; to retain all our <a
name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 387</span>possessions
in a spirit of humble and constant reliance upon the sovereign
power and disposal of the Almighty; to be lifting up our hearts,
in the course of our daily employment, above all secular
concerns, to the author of our being, to the giver of our talents
and our time, to the judge of all our actions.&nbsp; And besides,
some portion of each day must be distinctly set apart for holy
reading, meditation, and prayer.&nbsp; Without such rules and
observances, the christian principle cannot possibly be
maintained; faith and zeal will grow cold, the communion with God
be gradually impaired, the affections estranged, and the
obedience destroyed.</p>
<p>These remarks may serve to introduce an exposition of the 2nd
verse of the text.&nbsp; &ldquo;The works of the Lord are
great:&rdquo; yet great as they are, they cannot be understood
nor perceived by those, who are absorbed in earthly ideas and
pursuits.&nbsp; The attention will thus be entirely drawn off
from a contemplation of the works of Jehovah; and the mind will
entirely rest <a name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
388</span>upon its own labours and objects.&nbsp; To our own hand
and our own arm, to our own skill and enterprise, to our own
advantage and honour, we shall refer all the transactions of
life, and all the success and enjoyment with which we are
blessed.&nbsp; The dealings of our heavenly Father, both with
ourselves and with the world around us, will be utterly
overlooked; and however we may believe, as a speculative truth,
that His &ldquo;providence orders and governs all things both in
heaven and earth,&rdquo; we shall be in no way improved or
affected by that belief; in fact, we shall have no real or
practical persuasion of His providential government: we shall be
blind to His manifold mercies vouchsafed to ourselves, to our
brethren, and to the Church at large.</p>
<p>The works of the Lord must be &ldquo;sought out;&rdquo; that
is, they must be mindfully and diligently observed, in order to
their being adequately understood; nay, if we would know any
thing of their vastness or their excellency.&nbsp; We must be
continually <a name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
389</span>looking beyond human motives, human exertions, human
experience, if we would in any measure, comprehend or perceive
the merciful interpositions and dealings of God.&nbsp; We must be
in the constant habit of connecting the ordinary operations and
occurrences of life with a higher power, with the counsel and
government of heaven; a gracious promise is given, that
&ldquo;all things shall work together for good to them that love
God;&rdquo; and we must be always endeavouring to trace this
working, and observe the striking manner in which this effect is
produced.&nbsp; We shall thus be able to perceive, how
continually our merciful Father is watching over us, is crowning
our honest designs and labours with success, and is bringing good
even out of evil itself.&nbsp; We shall perceive, how wonderfully
He directs us to the most suitable means of accomplishing our
laudable purposes: how He over-rules those events, over which we
had no controul, for our benefit and prosperity; how He raises up
to us friends and fellow-workers, <a name="page390"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 390</span>when we least expected them; and
provides us comforters, where we looked for none; how, in the
season of danger, of which we are not even aware, He spreads over
us the shield of safety, and we come forth unhurt; how He compels
the designs, even of our enemies themselves, to minister in the
end to our advantage; how, in the various calamities and sorrows,
privations and disappointments, sicknesses and pains, which He
does permit to befal us, He brings us consolation under them, and
makes us to see and acknowledge, that what we lamented as a
grievance, is turned into a signal blessing.&nbsp; And whenever,
in any of our concerns or experiences, we fail to trace the mercy
of God, it is, for the most part, because we do not sufficiently
seek it out; because we are resting in our own short-sighted
views; because we are &ldquo;walking by sight and not by
faith,&rdquo; in &ldquo;the flesh and not in the spirit;&rdquo;
desiring benefit in our own ways, and not humbly discerning the
ways of the Lord; impatient under <a name="page391"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 391</span>the means, and not considering the
end; looking at the earthly instrument and agent, and forgetting
the prime Mover of all.</p>
<p>What I am seeking to recommend to you is this, not a mere
principle or matter of belief, but the importance of a constant,
daily observance of the events and transactions of life, in
reference to the almighty power and goodness of God.&nbsp; It is
a point not attended to, even by many sincere Christians, as it
ought to be; as to the generality, day after day passes by,
without any such reference at all.&nbsp; Every thing proceeds, in
their notion and view, from their own will and work, from the
good or evil working of others; and they are affected
accordingly; rejoicing or complaining, elevated or cast
down.&nbsp; They have no consideration of the great Ruler and
Preserver; they might almost be said to &ldquo;live without God
in the world;&rdquo; it amounts, at least, to a practical
disowning of His providence.</p>
<p>But I must repeat, that even from many <a
name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 392</span>sincere
Christians this great influential doctrine does not receive all
the attention, which its importance demands.&nbsp; They are
convinced, that &ldquo;the works of the Lord are great;&rdquo;
that His mighty operations are continually manifested, in the
moral and spiritual government of mankind; but they do not
sufficiently carry this conviction into their own daily walk in
life.&nbsp; Far would we be from implying, that such reflections
ought, in any way, to interfere with our circumspection or
diligence in worldly concerns; or that we are familiarly to mix
up religious observations with ordinary business or pleasure; but
we should have a mind and heart ever open to perceive the
gracious interpositions and visitations of heaven; we should be
alive to every providential deliverance from accident or danger,
both in ourselves and others: to the vouchsafement of every
blessing, both temporal and spiritual.&nbsp; And they, who are
thus disposed and ready, will find many opportunities drawing
them to God: many <a name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
393</span>circumstances and events, which they once regarded
somewhat in the light of chance, they will then clearly ascribe
to the sure, though silent working of that invisible power, by
which every thing in the universe is governed and sustained.</p>
<p>But the works of the Lord are &ldquo;sought out&rdquo; by
those only, &ldquo;who have pleasure therein:&rdquo; and this
will explain to us the true cause, why such lamentable numbers of
professed believers seldom or never seek them out at all.&nbsp;
They have no <i>pleasure</i> in their thoughts upon the Almighty:
they love Him not, serve Him not with a devoted and delighted
heart; their conscience is uneasy and self-condemning, and
therefore they reluctantly turn their thoughts to their great
Sovereign and Judge; it is rather a pain than a pleasure to them,
so to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;Loving the world and the things of the
world,&rdquo; they have no taste for spiritual enjoyment of any
kind: in extraordinary emergencies, when the interference of an
over-ruling power is irresistibly thrust upon their notice, <a
name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 394</span>they do not
refuse to join with their brethren in acknowledging the fact: but
as for searching out His ways and dealings in their daily
experience, they are decidedly disinclined and averse to it; the
injunction of such a practice is repugnant to their views and
feelings and desires.</p>
<p>Nor can any, but the pious and faithful servant of God, find
delight in this holy and profitable exercise: and the longer he
lives, the more clearly he perceives the hand of the Almighty in
every thing; in discomfiting the evil and blessing the good: he
sees and admires the wonders of grace, as well as the wonders of
providence, vouchsafed to others as well as himself; to the
Church in all ages.&nbsp; He reads, in the word of truth, of the
signal manner, in which the Lord has delivered His people from
the foundation of the world; not only by the miraculous
interposition of His omnipotent arm; but also in the ordinary
course of His dealings with them.&nbsp; How merciful <a
name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 395</span>and
manifold have been His ways of enlightening them when in
ignorance, and converting them when in sin.&nbsp; How pitifully
and patiently has He borne, not only with their infirmities, but
with their guilt and rebellion; and graciously reclaimed them
from the path of error and ruin, by the mercies of His chastising
rod.&nbsp; Nor do the defeat and destruction of wicked men afford
less decisive proof, than the deliverance of the righteous, of
the greatness of the Lord&rsquo;s works: the whole history of the
Church shews Him to have been great in justice, as in mercy: and,
we may add, in truth also.&nbsp; Often indeed have the promises
of divine favour, and the denunciations of vengeance, been
fulfilled in the most unexpected and marvellous manner; by
instruments apparently altogether unequal to the momentous object
designed.&nbsp; But &ldquo;the Lord worked for His people; and
there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by
few.&rdquo; <a name="citation395"></a><a href="#footnote395"
class="citation">[395]</a></p>
<p><a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 396</span>And
amongst his friends and brethren in the Lord, the christian also
beholds many satisfactory and encouraging instances of the
working of heavenly power: he sees them advancing in their
spiritual course, steadier in principle, and improved in
character, &ldquo;growing in grace and in the knowledge of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; And wherever he
observes the increase of true religion, there he also finds, to
his heart&rsquo;s delight, a correspondent increase of
contentment and happiness; the power of the gospel is manifest
before him, in the altered characters and lives of men; and in
all this, he perceives and admires the gracious operations of a
merciful God.</p>
<p>But the christian is best acquainted with himself; studies the
most narrowly his own conduct, and life; he judges indeed, with
deep humility, of the manifestation of divine power in his
behalf, sincerely conscious of his undeservings; still he can
truly bear witness that in his own case, his own experience also,
the works of the <a name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
397</span>Lord have been great.&nbsp; Though still far, in spirit
and in character, from what he ought to be and would be; he finds
himself continually gaining the mastery over his evil affections
and habits, and drawing nearer to God; perpetually advancing in
holiness, as in knowledge; more &ldquo;hungering and thirsting
after righteousness, and more filled;&rdquo; taking more delight
in spiritual ordinances, and shewing the fruit of them in his
life and conversation.&nbsp; And when he considers his own sinful
nature, and the powerful enemies opposed to him, he cannot but
ascribe this change in his heart, this improvement in his
conduct, to the mighty workings of heavenly grace.&nbsp; Unworthy
as he is of God&rsquo;s favour, he does find a well-spring of
comfort established in his soul; comfort at all times, especially
in the hour of tribulation; either he is provided with the means
of deliverance, or the tribulation itself is converted into a
blessing.&nbsp; He is also made in many ways, the instrument of
benefit to others, to his family or friends; and every door <a
name="page398"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 398</span>of
usefulness that is opened to him, he gratefully acknowledges to
be opened of the Lord.&nbsp; In all the good he receives or does,
and all the evil he escapes or prevents, he traces the power and
mercy of his God; &ldquo;not unto me, O Lord, not unto me, but
unto Thy name be the glory and the praise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus he
imitates the conduct of the Psalmist, recorded in the text;
&ldquo;I will give thanks unto the Lord with my whole
heart:&rdquo; it is not a formal service, not a partial tribute,
not a reluctant offering: all the powers of his understanding and
all the affections of his soul are employed in magnifying the
majesty and loving-kindness of the &ldquo;author and giver of
every good gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the grateful Christian imitates the Psalmist yet farther;
he does not hide the sense of God&rsquo;s goodness within his own
bosom; nor confine the mention of it to the narrow boundary of
his closet; but declares it openly as opportunity serves; first
of all &ldquo;in the assembly of the upright,&rdquo; or,
according to the better <a name="page399"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 399</span>version of the Prayer Book,
&ldquo;secretly among the faithful;&rdquo; in the company of his
family and his religious friends.&nbsp; When he has experienced
or observed the peculiar mercies of his almighty and merciful
Father, he delights to speak of them; though with humility, yet
with fervour and joy.&nbsp; Such is the natural disposition of
man, when he feels deeply the obligation of benefits conferred:
if an earthly friend has enriched or favoured him, he thankfully
makes mention of the kindness: and shall he do less for the
abundant, the infinite goodness of his God?&nbsp; Shall he not
rejoice to proclaim it in the very overflowing of his heart?</p>
<p>There are persons, who would draw a line of distinction
between the two cases; and say, that our obligations to God
should be felt only, and our obligations to man should be both
felt and proclaimed.&nbsp; It is probable, that such
observations, however sincerely made, generally proceed from the
want of spirituality of heart: there is an aversion to the
introduction of <a name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
400</span>religious topics, however sober or seasonable.&nbsp;
That they are often indiscreetly introduced, often in a spirit of
self-righteousness, and fanatical pretension, we cannot deny: but
the abuse of any holy exercise is not to prevent us from the
use.&nbsp; Look at the recorded lives of any pious Christians, of
those who are held up to us as patterns of righteousness, whom in
fact we profess to admire; and see how ready and forward they
were, on all occasions, to speak of the manifold works which God
had wrought for them, of the kindness which they had experienced
at His hands.&nbsp; The Psalms are full of such expressions and
resolutions: the text is a decided instance: let it have its
effect upon us: let every one who has been favoured of the Lord,
delight to be &ldquo;talking of His doings:&rdquo; not
intrusively, not boastingly, as if he were a special favourite of
heaven; as if he would make it appear, that the Lord were kinder
to him than to others: but with simplicity and singleness of
mind.&nbsp; The true believer abhors the two extremes, <a
name="page401"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 401</span>of
spiritual pride on the one hand; and of cold-hearted
insensibility on the other.&nbsp; He feels himself all
undeserving of the bounty of the Lord, and is astonished that it
should be so bestowed upon <i>him</i>, who is &ldquo;not worthy
to gather up the crumbs under his master&rsquo;s table;&rdquo;
but the bounty <i>is</i> bestowed, and he cannot let it pass
unnoticed or undeclared.</p>
<p>Again, the Psalmist says, &ldquo;in the assembly of the
upright and in the congregation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He vows, that not
only in the company of his faithful friends, but also in the
great congregation, in the holy temple, the power and mercy of
Jehovah shall be publicly proclaimed. <a
name="citation401"></a><a href="#footnote401"
class="citation">[401]</a>&nbsp; Not that any particular acts, of
providence or grace, could be there mentioned by name; but that
the thankfulness, which he feels <a name="page402"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 402</span>for them, would put new life and
energy into his praises, in the House of God.&nbsp; And this also
we shall do well to imitate; this we shall assuredly imitate, if
we have the true spirit of faith and piety.&nbsp; At all times,
the sincere worshipper has so powerful a sense of the divine
goodness in his heart, as to preserve him, in his public
thanksgivings, from indifference and languor; but there are
times, when he is visited with peculiar favour, with signal
deliverances and blessings; and the remembrance of them will
inspire him, when he next visits the temple of the Lord, with
more than ordinary ardour; &ldquo;out of the abundance of the
heart, the mouth speaketh;&rdquo; and as his love and gratitude
rise, his tribute of praise will ascend, in a loftier strain, to
the fountain of mercy, to the throne of grace.</p>
<p>And God will hear him, and accept the free-will offering; he
will return from worship in a holier frame, and with a more
heavenly temper; the incense which he has been wafting to the
skies, will leave <a name="page403"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
403</span>a fragrance behind, and spread to his character; and he
will be rendered meet, through the grace and intercession of his
Redeemer, for further manifestations of divine love.&nbsp; And O
still better fruit, still happier effects of his devout
thanksgiving! he will be preparing his soul for more exalted
praises in the world to come, amid the countless multitude of
worshippers, in the courts of the Lamb; where the holy-angels and
the glorified saints shall rejoice together, in seeking out and
recounting the surpassing love of God to His church and people,
to His universal creation in all ages.&nbsp; Exulting in the
light divine, and sharing together the blessedness of the
Saviour&rsquo;s triumph, praise shall be their constant
employment; and the vaults of heaven shall eternally echo with
this their joyful theme, &ldquo;Great and marvellous are Thy
works.&nbsp; Lord God Almighty; just and true are Thy ways, Thou
King of Saints.&rdquo; <a name="citation403"></a><a

<h2><a name="page404"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
404</span>SERMON XXII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">DILIGENCE AND PERSEVERANCE IN THE
CHRISTIAN RACE.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Philipp</span>. iii. 13, 14.</p>
<p><i>Brethren</i>, <i>I count not myself to have
apprehended</i>; <i>but this one thing I do</i>, <i>forgetting
those things which are behind</i>, <i>and reaching forth unto
those things which are before</i>, <i>I press toward the mark for
the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> what St. Paul had said in a
few verses before, he feared, lest he should have seemed to make
himself sure of salvation, without the necessity of any further
anxiety or labour; as if he might rest quietly satisfied with his
present views and attainments; and had nothing to do, but <a
name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 405</span>to wait for
the certain result.&nbsp; And truly, if such confidence and
relaxation could ever have been justified, it must have been in
the case of this apostle; witness the sacrifices which he had
made for the gospel; his unswerving and invincible faith; his
holiness of character; his unparallelled labours; and the many
signal marks of divine blessing, with which he had been
distinguished.</p>
<p>But still, he was far from presuming in this way; and the
resolution which he expresses in the text, and the account which
he gives of his own spirit and conduct, may furnish us with a
very suitable lesson, and teach us the absolute necessity of
continued watchfulness and diligence and perseverance unto the
end; may teach us, that we are not, as the prophet Ezekiel
expresses it, to &ldquo;<i>trust</i> in our own
righteousness;&rdquo; <a name="citation405"></a><a
href="#footnote405" class="citation">[405]</a> in any principles
we have formed, any views we have entertained, any holiness we
have acquired, any experiences with which we have been blessed;
<a name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 406</span>and thus
grow heedless and secure: but, that the further we advance, the
more we must be convinced of the need of exertion; the more we
shall find to do, and the more we shall be enabled to do: who
loiters, loses; loses the advantage of the ground he has gone
over; loses the means of a victorious and successful
accomplishment.</p>
<p>It will be improving, to those, who listen with humble and
teachable hearts, who spiritually receive the word of God as the
teaching of the Spirit of God, if we repeat a considerable
portion of the important passage connected with the text; let us
begin then with the 7th verse.&nbsp; &ldquo;What things were gain
to me, those I counted loss for Christ, yea doubtless, and I
count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of
Christ Jesus my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of all
things, (all earthly things) and do count them but dung, (as mere
refuse and worthlessness) that I may win Christ and be found in
Him, not having mine own righteousness, which <a
name="page407"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 407</span>is of the
law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
righteousness which is of God by faith: That I may know Him and
the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His
sufferings, being made conformable to His death, (by dying to sin
that I may live to God;) if by any means I might attain to the
resurrection of the dead,&rdquo; (to that perfect felicity, to
which the saints are admitted at the resurrection.)&nbsp; From
these words, it might have appeared to some, as if the apostle
had expected his great object to be already accomplished; as if
he had arrived at a state of faith and holiness, by which he had
actually secured this felicity, independently of any further
vigilance or labour: and therefore he immediately adds, by way of
caution and correction: &ldquo;Not as though I had already
attained, either were already perfect; but I follow after, (keep
following after the object before me,) if that I may apprehend
<i>that</i>, (may lay hold of <i>that</i> prize,) for which also
I am apprehended of Christ Jesus;&rdquo; (for which He, <a
name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 408</span>as it were,
has graciously laid hold of me, arresting me in my course of
blindness and obstinacy, as a malignant persecutor of Him and His
gospel.)&nbsp; Then follows the text; &ldquo;Brethren, I count
not myself to have apprehended;&rdquo; I reckon not upon the
prize as actually won; however high and fervent my hope, however
undoubted my assurance of ultimate success, I cannot be careless,
I must not diminish my anxiety or activity; my hope can only be
sustained in proportion to my vigour in the contest; success must
depend upon my unbending resolution and unabating constancy: the
victory is not gained in the middle of the course, and cannot be
gained till it is finished.</p>
<p>Many of us, no doubt, are aware, that the apostles, as well as
our blessed Lord, were in the habit of drawing their observations
and modes of instruction from the common transactions of daily
life; from the circumstances, by which they were surrounded; from
the manners and customs of the people, amongst whom they <a
name="page409"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
409</span>sojourned.&nbsp; Thus, when our Lord called Peter and
Andrew, who were fishermen, to be His disciples, He said,
&ldquo;Follow me and I will make you fishers of men.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And St. Paul, on the occasion before us, alludes to certain games
or sports, generally celebrated, and highly esteemed by the
people, whom he was addressing.&nbsp; One of these games was the
foot-race, in which a number of competitors contended together
for the prize; and, in the result of which, they and their
friends were deeply interested.&nbsp; Severe was the previous
training, which it was necessary for them to undergo; and great
and persevering the exertion necessary, in order to gain the
prize.&nbsp; It would readily occur to their minds, that if the
racer, who was out-stripping his opponents, were so to please
himself by the advantage he had gained, by thinking of the ground
he had successfully gone over, as to relinquish his efforts, as
to stop and look back upon his wonderful feats, and indolently
enjoy his satisfaction, that, by such folly he would soon lose
his superiority, <a name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
410</span>that his past endeavours would have been to little or
no purpose; it would be perfectly manifest to them, that nothing
could ensure his success, but the continuance of that activity,
which had placed him foremost in the trial.</p>
<p>Agreeably to this view and this figure, the apostle took his
resolution, and formed his principle and conduct in the christian
race.&nbsp; &ldquo;This one thing I do;&rdquo; this is the
unswerving purpose of my soul, this the plan and object by which
my whole course is constantly regulated; &ldquo;forgetting those
things which are behind, and reaching forth, (stretching out and
forward all the faculties of my body and soul) to those things
which are before, I press toward the mark.&rdquo;&nbsp; Great and
successful as his attainments already were, he did not dwell upon
them with a complacence and security, which should induce him to
relax; on the contrary, he forgot them, in the comparison and
prospect of the exertions which yet remained.</p>
<p><a name="page411"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 411</span>And
how much less reason have we, my brethren, to be satisfied with
our past character, with any thing that we have already
achieved.&nbsp; Woe to me! (may many of us say,) how large a
portion of my time has been consumed in indifference and
trifling! how long was it before I earnestly set out in the race
at all! and even after it was begun, I proceeded carelessly and
supinely, as if the prize had not been worth contending
for.&nbsp; How idly and insufficiently did I prepare for the
contest; expecting to gain the victory without a sacrifice or a
struggle! yea, and perhaps the best of us may look rather with
shame than satisfaction upon our christian attainments: how much
further might we have advanced, than we have done, if we had
commenced the good work in earlier life, or been more diligent:
how much more enlightened might our minds have now been, had we
more fervently sought, and more implicitly yielded to, the
teaching of the Spirit of God; had we been more frequently and
earnestly <a name="page412"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
412</span>&ldquo;searching the scriptures,&rdquo; more devout in
meditation and more constant in prayer: how much more purified
our hearts, and &ldquo;cleansed from all unrighteousness,&rdquo;
by a more sincere and unqualified subjection to the divine will;
how much higher our affections elevated, had they been more
conversant with heaven; how much more firmly and blamelessly our
feet have been fixed in the way of God&rsquo;s commandments, in
all the blessed ordinances of the gospel, in the narrow path of
life eternal, had we been more zealously and faithfully walking
with God.&nbsp; Nearer should we have been drawn to Him, in
holier and happier communion, had we not been so long, and so
often, cold and remiss.</p>
<p>No, my brethren, we have no reason to be dwelling, with such
delight and confidence, upon the progress we have already made,
as to feel ourselves privileged to be content.&nbsp; In no case,
would this be considered the evidence of a true christian
principle or view; in no case, <a name="page413"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 413</span>would it be the means of safety; nor
even consistent with the hope of salvation; no, not even in an
apostle; much less in us, whose faith is so weak, whose knowledge
so moderate, whose resolutions so wavering, whose attainments so
comparatively poor.&nbsp; On the contrary, we should sorrow over
our past failings; be deeply affected on considering how far we
have come short of what was required of us; and heartily desire
and pray, that the grievous remembrance may stimulate us to fresh
endeavours, with a &ldquo;new heart and a new spirit;&rdquo; that
so we may be &ldquo;reaching forth to those things which are
before.&rdquo;&nbsp; All that we have well done, and all that we
have left undone, should have, for this purpose, the same effect;
experiencing the blessed consequences of our holy labour, on the
one hand, we should be animated and encouraged to persevere in
the conflict, that we may gather thereby additional comfort and
success; and sensible of our deficiencies, on the other hand, in
a work of such inconceivable <a name="page414"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 414</span>and everlasting importance, we
should be anxious to repair our neglect; and thankful for our
opportunity of &ldquo;redeeming the time,&rdquo; and making
further advances.</p>
<p>Thank God, whatever our negligence may have been, all is not
lost; the course is yet before us, and we may go onward in the
spirit and strength of the Lord; the prize is yet before us, and
it may be won.&nbsp; But it requires a full purpose of heart, a
fixed determination, an undaunted courage, a strenuous exercise
of every faculty and every nerve: all that we are, and have, must
be devoted to the securing of the one great object.&nbsp; All the
talents of reason, with which our Creator has endued us; all the
energy of grace, with which our souls are supplied, must
incessantly be brought to bear upon our high and holy
calling.&nbsp; We must be daily and hourly proceeding; no
lingering, longing looks upon the world we are leaving behind us;
no loitering amid its vanities and follies; no backsliding to its
sinful pleasures and <a name="page415"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 415</span>pursuits; no declining from the
strict line of duty, as if it were become wearisome, as if it
were not fully believed to be right or requisite: &ldquo;the just
shall live by faith, but if any man draw back, my soul shall have
no pleasure in him.&nbsp; But we are not of them who draw back
unto perdition; but of them who believe to the saving of the
soul.&rdquo; <a name="citation415"></a><a href="#footnote415"
class="citation">[415]</a></p>
<p>St. Paul says, &ldquo;I press toward the mark;&rdquo; alluding
to the mark, or line, drawn across the end of the course, to shew
where it terminated.&nbsp; The end of our course is death; that
is the mark, to which we must constantly press; never, till we
reach it, can our striving be over, can the victory be
gained.&nbsp; If we perceive ourselves languishing or weary, if
the enemy of our souls would tempt us, as he undoubtedly will do,
to indolence or repose, let us instantly pray to our Almighty
Father, for a double portion of His Holy Spirit, and he will
enable us to renew our vigour, and maintain our
stedfastness.&nbsp; <a name="page416"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 416</span>Yea, though the race be so
protracted, that our limbs may be growing feeble with age, and
our vital energies decaying, still we shall be inspirited with a
courage and strength, that will be found abundantly sufficient;
and as we near the end, our hopes will rise, and our prospect
will brighten; the weakness of nature will be assisted and
compensated by a merciful increase of faith; and we shall press
onward, through the latter part of the trial, with holier
confidence and fuller expectation.</p>
<p>And all this, &ldquo;for the prize of our high calling in
Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; What was it, that led the people of
former days, to enter into the list, and engage in the
race?&nbsp; Why were they content to undergo such previous
hardships and privations, in order to qualify them for the
task?&nbsp; Why did they exert themselves in the contest, so
laboriously and painfully, as if willing to sacrifice their lives
in the struggle?&nbsp; It was for a little crown of withering
leaves; for the honour of their countrymen&rsquo;s applause; <a
name="page417"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 417</span>and the
approval of their families and friends.&nbsp; How then do they
put to shame the negligent and indifferent christian; him that
refuses to train and labour for the conflict of life, for the
cause of salvation!&nbsp; What is our prize? what are our
objects? &ldquo;an incorruptible crown,&rdquo; a &ldquo;crown of
glory that fadeth not away;&rdquo; an eternal inheritance in the
heavens; the approbation of all good men; the welcome acclaim of
a &ldquo;multitude of angels which no man can number;&rdquo; the
approval, the everlasting reward of the Judge of our christian
race.&nbsp; Are not these objects worthy of our supreme
regard?&nbsp; Is not this worth contending for?&nbsp; Does it not
demand all our attention, all our anxiety, all our watchfulness
and diligence and labour?&nbsp; Should not our whole soul be
devoted thereto?&nbsp; Ought it not to be, comparatively
speaking, the sole purpose, for which we care to live and hope to
die?</p>
<p>Especially when we consider the consequences of our failure,
in this great enterprise and work.&nbsp; He that lost the <a
name="page418"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 418</span>earthly
race, lost little; perhaps it was somewhat of an honour for him
to have contended at all: but he, who loses the christian race,
loses every thing; loses his own soul, his precious immortal
soul; defeat will be ruin, eternal misery and perdition.&nbsp; He
that lost the earthly prize on one occasion, might run for
another on a future day: but when once the spiritual race is run,
when we have arrived at the mark, at the goal, at the gate of
death, no further trial will then be vouchsafed; there will never
be another opportunity.&nbsp; Anxiously perhaps we may desire it;
and resolve, as we find ourselves approaching to the border of
eternity, that if we could be permitted to continue our race for
a little season, we would &ldquo;use all diligence&rdquo; for a
successful termination; to gain the great prize we appear to be
losing: but the desire will be vain.&nbsp; We knew the nature of
the prize before; we knew what was necessary in order to gain it;
we declined and refused; we chose the broad and easy way of
idleness and sin: the <a name="page419"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 419</span>night will be come, and there will
be no more working.</p>
<p>O that before, that long before this time shall come, all our
hearts may be thoroughly fixed upon the high calling of our God;
upon that blessed revelation of the gospel, which calls us to
life and immortality.&nbsp; O that the heart of every hearer may
be fixed this day, so as never to be diverted from the holy and
heavenly purpose; so as to be filled with a zeal and ardour, that
shall never be extinguished; with invincible courage, and
irremovable confidence; so that we may never &ldquo;be weary of
well-doing,&rdquo; but persevere unto the end.</p>
<p>The Saviour, on His lofty throne, calls us by <i>His word</i>,
which announces the glorious prize and the conditions of the
race; by <i>His spirit</i>, &ldquo;which is striving with
us;&rdquo; by His <i>heralds</i> and <i>messengers</i>, warning,
animating, exhorting, persuading; He promises strength for the
contest and victory in the end, to all who will engage in the
great cause, with earnestness <a name="page420"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 420</span>and sincerity.&nbsp; Awake, arise,
we have nothing to fear: &ldquo;the Lord is with us; who shall be
against us?&rdquo; who shall let or hinder?&nbsp; Listen, listen
to the invitation and the promise!&nbsp; Take them for your
government and your comfort; &ldquo;so run as to obtain;&rdquo;
so, that on arriving at the end of the christian course, you may
be calmly delighted to behold, with the eye of faith the crown of
victory and of glory, ready to be placed upon your head.&nbsp;
Often indeed are we permitted to behold the evident superiority
of grace, at the latter hour; the peculiar accordance of divine
mercy and strength, triumphing over the weakness of expiring
nature: many pious Christians have then openly exhibited the most
undoubted and convincing tokens of heavenly assurance and
support; their Lord thus manifestly affording them an
anticipation of their &ldquo;crown of rejoicing,&rdquo; and
cheering them before their dissolution.</p>
<p>At this awful hour, there may be, and doubtless are,
differences of spiritual experience <a name="page421"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 421</span>in different individuals: but
whatever, when we are ceasing to labour, be the foretaste of that
rest, &ldquo;which remaineth for the people of God;&rdquo;
whatever, when we are setting our foot upon the goal, be the
outward and visible sign of approaching glory; sure we may be, if
faithful unto death, that we shall soon enter upon that rest and
that glory; but a small moment is remaining: the prize is ready
at our departure: heaven will rejoice over us; the spirits of
just men made perfect, (many whose names we have honoured, some
whom we have seen and loved) will rejoice over us; and <i>we</i>
shall rejoice with them for ever.</p>

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
